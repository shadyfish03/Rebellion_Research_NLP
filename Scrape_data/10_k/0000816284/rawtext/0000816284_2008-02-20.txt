BUSINESS           Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively     we or our) is a global integrated     biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery,     development and commercialization of innovative therapies     designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory related     diseases. Our primary commercial stage products are     REVLIMID®     (lenalidomide) and     THALOMID®     (thalidomide).     REVLIMID®     was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or     FDA, the European Commission, or EC, Swiss Agency for     Therapeutic Products, or Swissmedic and Australian Therapeutic     Goods Administration, for treatment in combination with     dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at     least one prior therapy. In addition,     REVLIMID®     was approved by the FDA and the Canadian Therapeutic Products     Directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent     anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic     syndromes, or MDS, associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic     abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic     abnormalities.     THALOMID®     was approved by the FDA for treatment in combination with     dexamethasone of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma     and is also approved for the treatment and suppression of     cutaneous manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL,     an inflammatory complication of leprosy. We also sell     ALKERAN®,     which we obtain through a supply and distribution agreement with     GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, and     FOCALINtm,     which we sell exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis. We     continue to develop our international operations and expect them     to provide a significant contribution to future financial     results as our products obtain additional regulatory approval     for sale in foreign markets. Other sources of revenue include     royalties which we primarily receive from Novartis on its sales     of the entire family of     RITALIN®     drugs and FOCALIN     XRtm,     in addition to revenues from collaborative agreements and     licensing fees. Our broad portfolio of drug candidates in our     product pipeline includes     IMiDs®     compounds, which are proprietary to us and have demonstrated     certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important     properties. We believe that the catalysts for future growth     include: continued success of     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®;     depth of our product pipeline; favorable clinical data reported     at major medical conferences and in peer-reviewed publications;     additional product approvals from regulatory agencies; continued     international market expansion; successful integration of any     future product or business acquisitions.         We are dedicated to innovative research and development designed     to bring new therapies to market and are involved in research in     several scientific areas that may deliver proprietary     next-generation therapies, such as intracellular signaling,     immunomodulation and placental stem cell research. The therapies     (drugs and cell therapies) we develop are designed to treat     life-threatening diseases or chronic debilitating conditions     where patients are poorly served by current therapies. Building     on our growing knowledge of the biology underlying hematological     and solid tumor cancers and immune-inflammatory diseases, we are     investing in a range of innovative therapeutic programs that are     investigating ways to treat and chronically manage diseases by     targeting the disease source through multiple mechanisms of     action.         Our future growth and operating results will depend on continued     acceptance of our currently marketed products, regulatory     approvals of both new products and the expanded use of existing     products, depth of our product pipeline and ability to     commercialize these products, competition to our marketed     products and challenges to our intellectual property. We will     continue to expand our international infrastructure in     anticipation of additional international regulatory approvals     and commercialization of our products. See also Risk Factors     contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.         For the year ended December 31, 2007, we reported revenue     of $1.406 billion, net income of $226.4 million and     diluted earnings per share of $0.54, representing increases of     56.4%, 228.3% and 200.0%, respectively, compared to the year     ended December 31, 2006. This increase primarily reflects     the expanded use of     REVLIMID®,     partly offset by increased operating expenses required to     support our on-going research, commercial operations and     continued expansion into international markets.        1    Table of Contents   ACQUISITIONS         In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., d/b/a     Celgene Research San Diego, a privately held     biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and     development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease.         In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., which was a     privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord     blood banking business, developing technologies for the recovery     of stem cells from human placental tissues following the     completion of full-term, successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis     d/b/a Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, now operates as a     wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation engaged in the     research, recovery culture-expansion, preservation, development     and distribution of placental stem cells as therapeutic agents.         In October 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of     Penn T Limited, a UK-based global supplier of     THALOMID®.     This acquisition expanded our corporate capabilities and enabled     us to control manufacturing for     THALOMID®     worldwide. Through supply contracts acquired in this purchase,     we also increased our participation in the potential growth of     THALOMID®     revenues in key international markets.         In December 2006, we purchased an active pharmaceutical     ingredient, or API, manufacturing facility from Siegfried Ltd.     and Siegfried Dienste AG (together Siegfried)     located in Zofingen, Switzerland. The manufacturing facility has     the capability to produce multiple drug substances and is being     used to produce     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®     API to supply global markets. The facility may also be used to     produce drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates.     This asset acquisition expanded our manufacturing capabilities     and enabled us to control the production of     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®     worldwide.         In November 2007, we announced the signing of a definitive     merger agreement pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Pharmion     Corporation, or Pharmion. Under the terms of the merger     agreement, we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of     Pharmion common stock for $72.00 per share payable in a     combination of cash and shares of Celgene common stock. The     transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of     Directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing     conditions including the approval of the acquisition by Pharmion     stockholders and receipt of antitrust clearances. The     Hart-Scott-Rodino     Act, or HSR, thirty day waiting period has expired without the     United States Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requesting     additional information with regard to the merger. In addition,     the Bundeskartellamt, Germanys Federal Cartel Office in     charge of reviewing the antitrust aspects of mergers and     acquisitions, has cleared Celgenes pending acquisition of     Pharmion. On February 5, 2008 the     Form S-4     relating to the merger of Pharmion and Celgene was declared     effective by the United States Securities and Exchange     Commission, or SEC. The merger is expected to be completed in     March 2008. Refer to Note 2 Proposed Merger with     Pharmion Corporation contained within the consolidated     financial statements for additional information.     COMMERCIAL     STAGE PRODUCTS:     REVLIMID® (lenalidomide):  REVLIMID®     is an oral immunomodulatory drug approved by the FDA, the EC,     Swissmedic, and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration     for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for patients     with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior     therapy.     REVLIMID®     is also approved by the FDA and Canadian Therapeutic Products     Directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent     anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS, associated with a     deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional     cytogenetic abnormalities.     REVLIMID®     is distributed in the United States primarily through contracted     pharmacies under the     RevAssist®     program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution     program tailored specifically to help ensure, to the maximum     extent possible, the safe use of     REVLIMID®     and is being distributed in additional countries where approval     has been obtained as pricing, reimbursement and details of     controlled distribution in each market are determined.         REVLIMID®     continues to be evaluated in numerous clinical trials worldwide     either alone or in combination with one or more other therapies     in the treatment of a broad range of hematological malignancies,     including multiple myeloma, MDS, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, or     NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, other cancers and     other diseases.        2    Table of Contents       A Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, seeking approval     to market     REVLIMID®     for treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia due to     low-or-intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated     with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without     additional cytogenetic abnormalities was evaluated by the     European Medicines Agencys, or EMEA, Committee for     Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, and a negative     opinion was issued in January 2008. The CHMP concluded that     lenalidomide is efficacious in patients suffering from deletion     5q MDS. However, based on information available to the CHMP from     the uncontrolled, open-label, 148-patient Phase II study     (MDS-003), the CHMP was not convinced the data were sufficient     to assure safety. We intend to apply for a re-examination of the     CHMP opinion in accordance with relevant EMEA procedures. Other     international regulatory initiatives include MAAs currently     being evaluated in New Zealand and Israel.         In April 2007, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group reported     that its Data Monitoring Committees review of preliminary     results from a large, randomized clinical trial for patients     with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma found that the use of a     lower-dose of dexamethasone in combination with     REVLIMID®     suggests survival advantage for patients when compared to the     higher, standard-dose of dexamethasone that is used in     combination with     REVLIMID®     to treat the disease. These results were also presented at the     June 2007 annual American Society of Clinical Oncology medical     conference and updated at the December 2007 annual American     Society of Hematology meeting. The regulatory utility of these     findings will be discussed with the FDA.     THALOMID® (thalidomide):  THALOMID®     was approved by the FDA in May 2006 for use in combination with     dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed     multiple myeloma and in July 1998 for the treatment of acute     cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum     leprosum, or ENL, and as maintenance therapy for prevention and     suppression of the cutaneous manifestation of ENL recurrence.         THALOMID®     is distributed under our System for Thalidomide     Education and Prescribing Safety, or     S.T.E.P.S.®,     program which we developed and is a proprietary strategic     comprehensive education and risk-management distribution program     with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate     distribution and use of     THALOMID®.     Among other things,     S.T.E.P.S.®     requires prescribers, patients and dispensing pharmacies to     participate in a registry and an order cannot be filled unless     the physicians, patients and pharmacies have been registered,     trained and meet all qualification criteria.     ALKERAN®     (melphalan):  ALKERAN®     is licensed from GSK, and sold under the Celgene label.     ALKERAN®     was approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple     myeloma and of carcinoma of the ovary. Under terms of the     licensing agreement, we purchase     ALKERAN®     tablets and     ALKERAN®     for injection from GSK and distribute the products in the United     States. The agreement, which has been extended through     March 31, 2009, requires us to purchase certain minimum     quantities of     ALKERAN®     each year under a take-or-pay arrangement.     RITALIN® Family of Drugs:  In April 2000, we     licensed to Novartis the worldwide rights (excluding Canada) to     FOCALINtm     and FOCALIN     XRtm,     which are approved for the treatment of attention deficit     hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. We retained the rights to these     products for the treatment of oncology-related disorders. We     sell     FOCALINtm     exclusively to Novartis and also supply them with FOCALIN     XRtm,     for which we receive a royalty.         FOCALINtm     is formulated by isolating the active d-isomer of     methylphenidate and contains only the more active isomer     responsible for the effective management of the symptoms of     ADHD.     FOCALINtm     provides favorable tolerability and dosing flexibility at half     the dose of     RITALIN®.     PRECLINICAL     AND CLINICAL  STAGE PIPELINE:         Our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline of new drug     candidates, in addition to our cell therapies, is highlighted by     multiple classes of small molecule, orally administered     therapeutic agents designed to selectively regulate     disease-associated genes and proteins. The product candidates in     our pipeline are at various        3    Table of Contents       stages of preclinical and clinical development. Successful     results in preclinical or Phase I/II clinical studies may not be     an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or effectiveness of     a drug or product candidate.               Phase     I Clinical Trials           If the FDA allows a request to initiate clinical investigations     of a new drug or product candidate to become effective, Phase I     human clinical trials can begin. These tests usually involve     between 20 to 80 healthy volunteers or patients. The tests study     a drugs safety profile, and may include preliminary     determination of a drug or product candidates safe dosage     range. The Phase I clinical studies also determine how a drug is     absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body, and     the duration of its action.               Phase II     Clinical Trials           In Phase II clinical trials, studies are conducted on a     limited number of patients with the targeted disease. An initial     evaluation of the drugs effectiveness on patients is     performed and additional information on the drugs safety     and dosage range is obtained.               Phase III     Clinical Trials           This phase typically includes controlled multi-center trials and     involves a larger target patient population to ensure that study     results are statistically significant. During the Phase III     clinical trials, physicians monitor patients to determine     efficacy and to gather further information on safety.     IMiDs®:  IMiDs®     compounds are proprietary novel small molecule, orally available     compounds that modulate the immune system and other biologically     important targets through multiple mechanisms of action. We have     marketed     REVLIMID®     and have advanced two other     IMiDs®     compounds into clinical development, CC-4047 and CC-11006.     Additional compounds, including CC-10015, are in preclinical     development.         Our     IMiDs®     compounds are covered by an extensive and comprehensive     intellectual property estate of U.S. and foreign-issued     patents and pending patent applications including     composition-of-matter, use and other patents and patent     applications.     CC-4047:  CC-4047 (pomalidomide) is one     of the most potent     IMiDs®     compounds that we are developing. We opened our investigational     new drug, or IND, application to evaluate CC-4047 in a     U.S. proof-of-principle study in sickle cell anemia. We are     also evaluating CC-4047 for treatment in other diseases     including myelofibrosis, multiple myeloma and solid tumor     cancers.     CC-11006:  CC-11006 is another molecule     with activities distinct from those of     REVLIMID®     and CC-4047. Following successful completion of Phase I human     clinical trials, we are currently evaluating conditions where     this profile will have best therapeutic application including an     ongoing Phase I clinical trial in MDS.     ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS:  In May     2007, we announced plans to advance the development of leading     oral anti-inflammatory candidates across a broad range of     inflammatory diseases. Our oral PDE-4 inhibitor, CC-10004     (apremilast), is a member of a proprietary pipeline of novel     small molecules with anti-inflammatory activities that impede     the production of multiple proinflammatory mediators by     inhibiting PDE-4 resulting in reductions in TNF-α as well     as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-17 and IL-23, interferon-gamma,     leukotrienes and nitric oxide synthase. Apremilast is our lead     investigational drug in this class of anti-inflammatory     compounds. Based on results from proof-of-mechanism studies, we     are accelerating clinical and regulatory strategies for     apremilast in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as     embarking on exploratory clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis     and additional rheumatic, dermatologic and inflammatory diseases     to determine the potential of apremilast across a broad range of     debilitating inflammatory diseases. We believe that our second     oral PDE-4 inhibitor, CC-11050, which has completed Phase I     trials, will also prove to be effective in a number of     inflammatory conditions and is moving forward with its     development.     KINASE INHIBITORS:  We have generated     valuable intellectual property in the identification of kinases     that regulate pathways critical in inflammation and oncology.     Our kinase inhibitor platform includes inhibitors        4    Table of Contents       of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or JNK, pathway, and inhibitors     of the NFkB pathway. The JNK inhibitor, CC-401, has successfully     completed a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers and in acute     myelogenous leukemia, or AML, patients to determine safety and     tolerability. No further studies are planned at this time as we     intend to advance other JNK inhibitors. An investigational new     drug application was filed for CC-930 on December 18, 2007     and the application was approved in January 2008. Phase I     testing is scheduled to begin in February 2008.     LIGASE INHIBITORS:  Our work has defined     ubiquitin ligases that regulate the degradation of intracellular     proteins. These ligases, as a class of targets, have broad     potential for drug discovery in oncology. By identifying drug     targets and compounds that regulate ligase pathways, we are     addressing the potential to develop an important new class of     anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory therapeutics.     PLEIOTROPIC PATHWAY MODIFIERS:  Based     upon our observations about the effect of therapeutics to modify     multiple intracellular signaling pathways in distinct cell     types, we have identified a new class of molecules that impact     activity of several key pathways of therapeutic relevance. The     first of these, CC-16057, has moved into preclinical development     for inflammatory conditions.     STEM CELLS:  At Celgene Cellular     Therapeutics, or CCT, we are researching stem cells derived from     the human placenta as well as from the umbilical cord. CCT is     our state-of-the-art research and development division dedicated     to fulfilling the promise of cellular technologies by developing     cutting-edge products and therapies that will significantly     benefit patients. Our goal is to develop proprietary cell     therapy products for the treatment of unmet medical needs.         Stem cell based therapies offer the potential to provide     disease-modifying outcomes for serious diseases which today lack     adequate therapy. We have developed proprietary technology for     collecting, processing, and storing placental stem cells with     potentially broad therapeutic applications in cancer,     auto-immune diseases, including Crohns disease and     multiple sclerosis, neurological disorders including stroke and     ALS, graft-versus-host disease and other immunological and     rheumatilogical disorders. Our studies of the placenta indicate     that it is a rich source of potential products with biological     activity and therapeutic promise. Our lead product, PDA-001, is     completing preclinical studies. We plan to submit our first IND     in the second half of 2008.         In December 2006, CCT submitted an IND for our human placental     derived stem cell, or HPDSC, product. We also maintain an IND     with the FDA for a trial with cord blood in sickle cell anemia.     Additional preclinical research to define further the potential     of placental-derived stem cells and to characterize other     placental-derived products is continuing.        5    Table of Contents   CELGENE     LEADING PRODUCT CANDIDATES         The development of our leading new drug candidates and their     targeted disease indications are outlined in the following table:                                  Disease               Product         Indication         Status                IMiDs Compounds:                           CC-4047            Solid tumor cancers Myelofibrosis Hemoglobinopathies      Multiple myeloma           Phase II trials initiated      Phase II trial ongoing      Phase I-II trial initiated      Phase II trial planned          CC-11006            Hematological malignances           Phase I/II trial ongoing in MDS          CC-10015            Inflammatory diseases           Pre-clinical studies ongoing          CC-0478765            Inflammatory diseases           Pre-clinical studies ongoing          CC-0478995            Inflammatory diseases           Pre-clinical studies ongoing          Oral Anti-Inflammatory:                           CC-10004            Psoriasis Psoriatic arthritis Inflammatory diseases           Phase II trial in severe psoriasis ongoing and IIb trial in     moderate to severe psoriasis planned      Phase II trials ongoing      Phase II trials planned          CC-11050            Inflammatory diseases           Phase II trials planned         PPM (Pleiotropic Pathway Modifiers):                          CC-16057            Inflammatory diseases           Pre-clinical studies ongoing          Kinase Inhibitors:                           JNK 930            Fibrotic diseases           Phase I trial initiating          Stem Cell:                           HPDSC            Transplants, hematological  disorders      Orthopedics           Phase I trials initiating       Preclinical studies ongoing          PDA-001            Autoimmune/cancer      Crohns disease      Multiple sclerosis      ALS      GVHD     Stroke           Pre-clinical studies ongoing Pre-clinical studies ongoing     Pre-clinical studies ongoing Pre-clinical studies ongoing     Pre-clinical studies ongoing Pre-clinical studies ongoing         PATENTS     AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY         Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our     business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our     inventions, and also to rely upon trade secrets, know-how,     continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities     to develop and maintain our competitive position.         We own or have exclusively licensed at least 155 issued     U.S. patents and at least 285 additional U.S. patent     applications are pending. While we have a policy to seek     worldwide patent protection for our inventions, we have foreign     patent rights corresponding to most of our U.S. patents.     Further, although     THALOMID®     is approved for use associated with ENL, we do not have patent     protection relating to the use of     THALOMID®     to treat ENL.         In August 2001, we entered into an agreement, termed the     New Thalidomide Agreement, with EntreMed, Inc.,     Childrens Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC, and     Bioventure Investments, KFT relating to patents and patent     applications owned by CMCC, which agreement superceded several     agreements already        6    Table of Contents       in place between CMCC, EntreMed and us. Pursuant to the New     Thalidomide Agreement, CMCC directly granted to us an exclusive     worldwide license under the relevant patents and patent     applications relating to thalidomide. Several U.S. patents     have been issued to CMCC in this patent family and certain of     these patents expire in 2013 and 2014. Corresponding foreign     patent applications and additional U.S. patent applications     are still pending.         In addition to the New Thalidomide Agreement, we entered into an     agreement, entitled the New Analog Agreement, with     CMCC and EntreMed in December 2002, pursuant to which we have     been granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain CMCC     patents and patent applications relating to thalidomide analogs.     The New Analog Agreement was executed in connection with the     settlement of certain pending litigation by and among us,     EntreMed and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relating     to the allowance of certain CMCC patent applications covering     thalidomide analogs. These patent applications had been licensed     exclusively to EntreMed in the field of thalidomide analogs. In     conjunction with the settlement of these suits, we acquired     equity securities in EntreMed, and EntreMed terminated its     license agreements with CMCC relating to thalidomide analogs. In     turn, under the New Analog Agreement, CMCC exclusively licensed     to Celgene these patents and patent applications, which relate     to analogs, metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products of     thalidomide, and stereoisomers thereof. Under the New Analog     Agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain milestones     and other obligations, including those relating to     REVLIMID®     approval and sales.         The New Analog Agreement grants us control over the prosecution     and maintenance of the licensed thalidomide analog patent     rights. The New Analog Agreement also granted us an option to     inventions in the field of thalidomide analogs that may be     developed at CMCC in the laboratory of Dr. Robert     DAmato, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a separate     Sponsored Research Agreement negotiated between CMCC and us.         Our research led us to seek patent protection for molecular     targets and drug discovery technologies, as well as therapeutic     and diagnostic products and processes. More specifically,     proprietary technology has been developed for use in molecular     target discovery, the identification of regulatory pathways in     cells, assay design and the discovery and development of     pharmaceutical product candidates. As of December 2007, included     in those inventions described above, we owned, in whole or in     part, 49 issued U.S. patents and approximately     57 U.S. pending patent applications, including pending     provisional applications. An increasing percentage of our     San Diego subsidiarys recent patent applications have     been related to potential product candidates or compounds. It     also holds licenses to U.S. patents and U.S. patent     applications, some of which are licensed exclusively or     sub-licensed     to third parties in connection with sponsored or collaborative     research relationships.         CCT, our cellular therapeutics subsidiary, seeks patent     protection for the collection, processing, composition,     formulation and uses of mammalian placental and umbilical cord     tissue and placental and umbilical cord stem cells, as well as     cells and biomaterials derived from the placenta. As of December     2007, CCT owned, in whole or in part, five U.S. patents,     and more than 48 U.S. patent applications, including     pending provisional applications, and holds licenses to     U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications, including     certain patents and patent applications related to cord blood     collection and storage.         Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and     enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to     technology owned by third parties where it is necessary to     conduct our business without infringing upon the proprietary     rights of others. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and     biotechnology firms, including ours, can be uncertain and     involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the     coverage sought in a patent application can be significantly     reduced before the patent is issued.         Consequently, we do not know whether any of our owned or     licensed pending patent applications, which have not already     been allowed, will result in the issuance of patents or, if any     patents are issued, whether they will be dominated by     third-party patent rights, whether they will provide significant     proprietary protection or commercial advantage or whether they     will be circumvented, opposed or infringed by others. Finally,     we are also aware of third-party U.S. patents that relate     to the use of certain stem cell technologies and cannot     guarantee that our patents or pending applications will not be     involved in, or be defeated as a result of,        7    Table of Contents       opposition proceedings before a foreign patent office or any     interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and     Trademark Office.         With respect to patents and patent applications we have     licensed-in, there can be no assurance that additional patents     will be issued to any of the third parties from whom we have     licensed patent rights, either with respect to thalidomide or     thalidomide analogs, or that, if any new patents are issued,     such patents will not be opposed, challenged, invalidated,     infringed or dominated or provide us with significant     proprietary protection or commercial advantage. Moreover, there     can be no assurance that any of the existing licensed patents     will provide us with proprietary protection or commercial     advantage. Nor can we guarantee that these licensed patents will     not be either infringed, invalidated or circumvented by others,     or that the relevant agreements will not be terminated. Any     termination of the licenses granted to Celgene by CMCC could     have a material adverse effect on our business, financial     condition and results of operations.         Because 1) patent applications filed in the United States     on or before November 28, 2000 are maintained in secrecy     until patents issue, 2) patent applications filed in the     U.S. on or after November 29, 2000 are not published     until approximately 18 months after their earliest claimed     priority date and 3) publication of discoveries in the     scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual     discoveries, we cannot be certain that we, or our licensors,     were the first to make the inventions covered by each of the     issued patents or pending patent applications or that we, or our     licensors, were the first to file patent applications for such     inventions. In the event a third party has also filed a patent     for any of our inventions, we, or our licensors, may have to     participate in interference proceedings before the     U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of     invention, which could result in the loss of a U.S. patent     or loss of any opportunity to secure U.S. patent protection     for the invention. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to     us, such interference proceedings could result in substantial     cost to us.         We are aware of U.S. patents that have been issued to third     parties claiming subject matter relating to the NFκB     pathway, including U.S. patents which could overlap with     technology claimed in some of our owned or licensed NFκB     patents or patent applications, and a U.S. patent that has     been asserted against certain pharmaceutical companies. With     respect to those patents that overlap with our applications, we     believe that one or more interference proceedings may be     initiated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to     determine priority of invention for this subject matter. While     we cannot predict the outcome of any such proceedings, in the     event we do not prevail, we believe that we can use alternative     methods for our NFκB drug discovery program for which we     have issued U.S. patents that are not claimed by the     subject matter of the third-party patents. We are also aware of     third-party U.S patents that relate to the use of certain     TNF-α inhibitors to treat inflammation or conditions such     as asthma.         We may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing     patents or we may be required to obtain licenses to such     patents. However, we do not know whether such licenses will be     available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.     Prosecution of patent applications and litigation to establish     the validity and scope of patents, to assert patent infringement     claims against others and to defend against patent infringement     claims by others can be expensive and time-consuming. There can     be no assurance that, in the event that claims of any of our     owned or licensed patents are challenged by one or more third     parties, any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge     will determine that such patent claims are valid and     enforceable. An adverse outcome in such litigation could cause     us to lose exclusivity relating to the subject matter delineated     by such patent claims and may have a material adverse effect on     our business. If a third party is found to have rights covering     products or processes used by us, we could be forced to cease     using the products or processes covered by the disputed rights,     subject to significant liabilities to such third party     and/or be     required to license technologies from such third party. Also,     different countries have different procedures for obtaining     patents, and patents issued by different countries provide     different degrees of protection against the use of a patented     invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that     the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an     invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of     patents covering the same invention or that any judicial     interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the     claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the     judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued     in another country. Competitors may choose to file oppositions     to patent applications, which have been deemed allowable by     foreign patent examiners. Furthermore, even if our owned or     licensed patents are determined to be valid and        8    Table of Contents       enforceable, there can be no assurance that competitors will not     be able to design around such patents and compete with us using     the resulting alternative technology. Additionally, for these     same reasons, we cannot be sure that patents of a broader scope     than ours may be issued and thereby create freedom to operate     issues. If this occurs we may need to reevaluate pursuing such     technology, which is dominated by others patent rights, or     alternatively, seek a license to practice our own invention,     whether or not patented.         We also rely upon unpatented, proprietary and trade secret     technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality     agreements with our collaborative partners, employees,     consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored     researchers and other advisors. There can be no assurance that     these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will     not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any     such breach or that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and     technological advances will not otherwise become known to     others. In addition, there can be no assurance that, despite     precautions taken by us, others have not and will not obtain     access to our proprietary technology or that such technology     will not be found to be non-proprietary or not a trade secret.     GOVERNMENTAL     REGULATION         Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and     other countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and     marketing of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and     development activities. Most, if not all, of our therapeutic     products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies     prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic     products are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and     clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by     the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the     United States, various federal and in some cases state statutes     and regulations also govern or impact upon the manufacturing,     testing for safety and effectiveness, labeling, storage,     record-keeping and marketing of such products. The lengthy     process of seeking required approvals, and the continuing need     for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require     the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval,     if and when obtained, may be limited in scope which may     significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may     be marketed. Further, approved drugs, as well as their     manufacturers, are subject to ongoing review and discovery of     previously unknown problems with such products or the     manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their     production may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale     or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure by     us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or     licensees to obtain or maintain, or any delay in obtaining,     regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our     products and our ability to receive product revenue, license     revenue or profit sharing payments.         The activities required before a product may be marketed in the     United States begin with preclinical testing not involving human     subjects. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a     product candidates chemistry and its biological activities     and the conduct of animal studies to assess the potential safety     and efficacy of a product candidate and its formulations. The     results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of     an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must be     reviewed by the FDA primarily for safety considerations before     proposed clinical trials in humans can begin.         Typically, clinical trials involve a three-phase process as     previously described. In some cases, further studies (Phase     IV) are required as a condition for new drug application,     or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, approval, to     provide additional information concerning the drug or product.     The FDA requires monitoring of all aspects of clinical trials,     and reports of all adverse events must be made to the agency     before drug approval. After approval, we have ongoing reporting     obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the     drug, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected     adverse events. Additionally, we may have limited control over     studies conducted with our proprietary compounds or biologics if     such studies are performed by others (e.g., cooperative groups     and the like).         The results of the preclinical testing and clinical trials are     submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA for evaluation to     determine if the product is sufficiently safe and effective for     approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA     or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional     information or deny the application if it determines that the     application does not satisfy its        9    Table of Contents       regulatory approval criteria. When an NDA or BLA is approved,     the NDA or BLA holder must a) employ a system for obtaining     reports of experience and side effects associated with the drug     and make appropriate submissions to the FDA and b) timely     advise the FDA if any marketed product fails to adhere to     specifications established by the NDA or BLA internal     manufacturing procedures.         Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the     FDA designate a drug intended to treat a rare disease or     condition as an orphan drug. The term     orphan drug can refer to either a drug or biologic.     A rare disease or condition is defined as one which affects less     than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects     more than 200,000 people, but for which the cost of     developing and making available the product is not expected to     be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.     Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated     as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of     that NDA or BLA is entitled to seven years of exclusive     marketing rights in the United States for such drug or product     containing the active ingredient for the same indication unless     the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient     quantities of the drug to meet the needs of persons with the     disease. However, orphan drug status is particular to the     approved indication and does not prevent another company from     seeking approval of other labeled indications. The period of     orphan exclusivity is concurrent with any patent exclusivity     that relates to the drug or biologic. Orphan drugs may also be     eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated     with the drugs development. Possible amendment of the     Orphan Drug Act by the U.S. Congress and possible     reinterpretation by the FDA has been discussed by regulators and     legislators. FDA regulations reflecting certain definitions,     limitations and procedures for orphan drugs initially went into     effect in January 1993 and were amended in certain respects in     1998. Therefore, there is no assurance as to the precise scope     of protection that may be afforded by orphan drug status in the     future or that the current level of exclusivity and tax credits     will remain in effect. Moreover, even if we have an orphan drug     designation for a particular use of a drug, there can be no     assurance that another company also holding orphan drug     designation will not receive approval prior to us for the same     indication. If that were to happen, our applications for that     indication could not be approved until the competing     companys seven-year period of exclusivity expired. Even if     we are the first to obtain approval for the orphan drug     indication, there are certain circumstances under which a     competing product may be approved for the same indication during     our seven-year period of exclusivity. First, particularly in the     case of large molecule drugs or biologics, a question can be     raised whether the competing product is really the same     drug as that which was approved. In addition, even in     cases in which two products appear to be the same drug, the     agency may approve the second product based on a showing of     clinical superiority compared to the first product.     REVLIMID®     has been granted orphan medicinal product designation by the EC     for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia following the     favorable opinion of the EMEAs Committee for Orphan     Medicinal Products.         Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement     that the prospective manufacturers quality control and     manufacturing procedures continually conform with the FDAs     current Good Manufacturing Practice, cGMP, regulations (which     are regulations established by the FDA governing the     manufacture, processing, packing, storage and testing of drugs     and biologics intended for human use). In complying with cGMP,     manufacturers must devote extensive time, money and effort in     the area of production and quality control and quality assurance     to maintain full technical compliance. Manufacturing facilities     and company records are subject to periodic inspections by the     FDA to ensure compliance. If a manufacturing facility is not in     substantial compliance with these requirements, regulatory     enforcement action may be taken by the FDA, which may include     seeking an injunction against shipment of products from the     facility and recall of products previously shipped from the     facility.         Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and     Cosmetic Act, products covered by approved NDAs or supplemental     NDAs may be protected by periods of patent     and/or     non-patent exclusivity. During the exclusivity periods, the FDA     is generally prevented from granting effective approval of an     abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. Further, NDAs submitted under     505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act may not reference     data contained in the NDA for a product protected by an     effective and unexpired exclusivity. ANDAs and 505(b)(2)     applications are generally less burdensome than full NDAs in     that, in lieu of new clinical data, the applications rely in     whole, or in part, upon the safety and efficacy findings of the     referenced approved drug in conjunction with bridging data,     typically bioequivalence data. Upon the expiration        10    Table of Contents       of the applicable exclusivities, through passage of time or     successful legal challenge, the FDA may grant effective approval     of an ANDA for a generic drug, or may accept reference to a     previously protected NDA in a 505(b)(2) application. Depending     upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities, any such     approval could be limited to certain formulations     and/or     indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any outstanding     exclusivities. While the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act provides     for ANDA and 505(b)(2) abbreviated approval pathways for drugs     submitted as NDAs and approved under section 505 of the     Act, there are no similar provisions for biologics submitted as     BLAs and approved under the Public Health Service, or PHS, Act.     That is, there is currently no abbreviated application that     would permit approval of a generic or follow-on     biologic based on the Agencys earlier approval of another     manufacturers application under section 351 of the     PHS Act.         Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements     can result in enforcement actions such as warning letters,     recalls or adverse publicity issued by the FDA or in legal     actions such as seizures, injunctions, fines based on the     equitable remedy of disgorgement, restitution and criminal     prosecution.         Approval procedures similar to those in the United States must     be undertaken in virtually every other country comprising the     market for our products before any such product can be     commercialized in those countries. The approval procedure and     the time required for approval vary from country to country and     may involve additional testing. There can be no assurance that     approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all. In     addition, regulatory approval of drug and biologics pricing is     required in most countries other than the United States. There     can be no assurance that the resulting pricing of our products     would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us.     COMPETITION         The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in which we     compete are each highly competitive. Our competitors include     major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which     have considerably greater financial, scientific, technical and     marketing resources than us. We also experience competition in     the development of our products and processes from universities     and other research institutions and, in some instances, compete     with others in acquiring technology from such sources.         Competition in the pharmaceutical industry, and specifically in     the oncology and immune-inflammatory areas being addressed by     us, is particularly intense. Numerous pharmaceutical,     biotechnology and generic companies have extensive anti-cancer     and anti-inflammatory drug discovery, development and commercial     resources. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Amgen Inc., Genentech,     Inc., Sanofi-Aventis SA., Novartis AG, AstraZeneca PLC., Eli     Lilly and Company, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd, Millennium     Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd., Biogen Idec Inc., Merck     and Co., Inc., Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer Inc. are among     some of the companies researching and developing new compounds     in the oncology, inflammation and immunology fields.         The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have undergone,     and are expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant     technological change. Also, consolidation and competition are     expected to intensify as technical advances in each field are     achieved and become more widely known. In order to compete     effectively, we will be required to continually upgrade and     expand our scientific expertise and technology, identify and     retain capable personnel and pursue scientifically feasible and     commercially viable opportunities.         Our competition will be determined in part by the indications     and geographic markets for which our products are developed and     ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. An important     factor in competition will be the timing of market introduction     of our or our competitors products. Accordingly, the     relative speed with which we can develop products, complete     clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, receive     pricing and reimbursement in certain markets and supply     commercial quantities of products to the market are expected to     be important competitive factors. Competition among products     approved for sale will be based, among other things, on product     efficacy, safety, convenience, reliability, availability, price,     third-party reimbursement and patent and non-patent exclusivity.        11    Table of Contents   SIGNIFICANT     ALLIANCES         From time to time we enter into strategic alliances with third     parties whereby we either grant rights to certain of our     compounds in exchange for rights to receive payments, or acquire     rights to compounds owned by other pharmaceutical or     biotechnology companies in exchange for obligations to make     payments to the partnering companies. Payments either to or from     third parties may be in the form of upfront payments, milestone     payments contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined     criteria     and/or     research and development funding. Under these arrangements, one     of the parties may also purchase product and pay royalties on     product sales. The following are our most significant alliances:     NOVARTIS:  In April 2000, we entered     into a development and license agreement with Novartis in which     we granted to Novartis an exclusive worldwide license (excluding     Canada) to further develop and market     FOCALINtm     and FOCALIN     XRtm,     the extended release drug formulation (d-methylphenidate, or     d-MPH). We have retained the exclusive commercial rights to     FOCALINtm     IR and FOCALIN     XRtm     for oncology-related disorders. We also granted Novartis rights     to all of our related intellectual property and patents,     including new formulations of the currently marketed     RITALIN®.     Under the agreement, we have received upfront and regulatory     achievement milestone payments totaling $55.0 million     through December 31, 2007 and are entitled to additional     payments upon attainment of certain other milestone events. We     also sell     FOCALINtm     to Novartis and receive royalties on all of Novartis sales     of FOCALIN     XRtm     and     RITALIN®     family of ADHD-related products.     PHARMION:  In November 2001, we licensed     to Pharmion Corporation exclusive rights relating to the     development and commercial use of our intellectual property     covering thalidomide and     S.T.E.P.S®.     Under the terms of the agreement, as amended in December 2004,     we receive royalties of 8% of Pharmions net thalidomide     sales in countries where Pharmion has received regulatory     approval and     S.T.E.P.S®     licensing fees of 8% of net sales in all other licensed     territories. In December 2004, following our acquisition of Penn     T Limited in which, among other things, we acquired a product     supply agreement to exclusively supply Pharmion with     thalidomide, we entered into an amended thalidomide supply     agreement whereby in exchange for a reduction in Pharmions     purchase price to 15.5% of its net sales of thalidomide, we     received a one-time payment of $77.0 million. Pursuant to a     separate December 2004 agreement, we also received a one-time     payment of $3.0 million in return for granting license     rights to Pharmion to develop and market thalidomide in     additional territories and eliminating certain of our license     termination rights. Under the agreements, as amended, the     territory licensed to Pharmion is for all countries other than     the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and China, with the     exception of Hong Kong. The agreements with Pharmion terminate     upon the ten-year anniversary following receipt of the first     regulatory approval for thalidomide in the United Kingdom.         To support the further clinical development of thalidomide,     Pharmion has also provided research funding under various     agreements of approximately $16.0 million through     December 31, 2007.         As of December 31, 2007, we held 1,939,598 shares of     Pharmion common stock received in connection with the conversion     of a five-year Senior Convertible Promissory Note and the     exercise of warrants purchased in April 2003 under a Securities     Purchase Agreement and the exercise of warrants received in     connection with the November 2001 thalidomide and     S.T.E.P.S®     license agreement.         On November 18, 2007, we entered into a merger agreement     with Pharmion under which Pharmion will be acquired and become a     wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene. The transaction will be     accounted for as a purchase and we anticipate that the     transaction will close in March 2008, subject to customary     closing conditions including the approval of the acquisition by     Pharmion stockholders. Refer to Note 2 Proposed     Merger with Pharmion Corporation contained within the     consolidated financial statements for additional information.     GLAXOSMITHKLINE:  In March 2003, we     entered into a supply and distribution agreement with GSK to     distribute, promote and sell     ALKERAN®     (melphalan), a therapy approved by the FDA for the     palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the     ovary. Under the terms of the agreement, we purchase     ALKERAN®     tablets and     ALKERAN®     for injection from GSK and distribute the products in the United     States under the Celgene label. The agreement requires us to     purchase certain minimum quantities each year under a        12    Table of Contents   take-or-pay     arrangement. The agreement has been extended through     March 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2007, the remaining     minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled     $38.2 million, including $30.5 million in 2008 and     $7.7 million in 2009.     MANUFACTURING         We own and operate an FDA approved active pharmaceutical     ingredient, or API, manufacturing facility in Zofingen,     Switzerland. The API facility is used to produce     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®     API. We have contracted with third party manufacturing service     providers in order to provide backup manufacturing capabilities.     These manufacturing service providers manufacture API in     accordance with our specifications and are required to meet the     FDAs and foreign regulatory authorities cGMP     regulations and guidelines. Our backup API manufacturing service     providers are Aptuit Inc. UK (previously Evotec) with respect to     REVLIMID®     and Aptuit Inc. with respect to     THALOMID®.         We have constructed a drug product manufacturing facility in     Neuchatel, Switzerland to perform formulation, encapsulation,     packaging, warehousing and distribution, and expect European and     FDA approval in 2008. We maintain backup FDA drug product     manufacturing service providers for the manufacture of     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®.     These drug product manufacturing service providers include Penn     Pharmaceutical Ltd, Institute of Drug Technology Australia Ltd     and OSG Norwich Pharmaceuticals. Our packaging service providers     include Sharp Corporation for worldwide packaging, Norwich     Pharmaceuticals and Cimex AG for US packaging and non US     packaging respectively.         The API for     FOCALINtm     and FOCALIN     XRtm     is currently obtained from two suppliers, Johnson Matthey Inc.     and Siegfried USA Inc., and we rely on a single manufacturer,     Mikart, Inc., for the tabletting and packaging of     FOCALINtm     finished product.         CCT currently operates an FDA compliant facility for the     recovery and storage of cordblood and placental stem cells for     LifeBank USA. We are also implementing in-house capability for     production of culture expanded placenta derived stem cells under     GMP, to supply clinical studies of PDA001 and other future stem     cell products.     INTERNATIONAL     OPERATIONS         Our international headquarters are located in Neuchatel,     Switzerland and in 2007, we completed construction of a drug     product manufacturing facility to perform formulation,     encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and distribution. We     purchased an API manufacturing facility located in Zofingen,     Switzerland which has the capability to produce multiple drug     substances, expanding our global commercial manufacturing     capabilities. We continue to expand our international     regulatory, clinical and commercial infrastructure in various     parts of the world.     REVLIMID®     has been granted approval by the EC, Swissmedic and Australian     Therapeutic Goods Administration as a treatment for multiple     myeloma who received at least one prior therapy.     REVLIMID®     has also been approved by the Canadian Therapeutic Products     Directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent     anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS, associated with a     deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional     cytogenetic abnormalities.         We granted Pharmion Corporation a license to expand the     THALOMID®     franchise in certain parts of the world, accelerating the     establishment of     THALOMID®     as an important therapy in the international markets. In October     2004, we acquired Penn T Limited, a supplier of     THALOMID®.     This acquisition has enabled us to manage the manufacturing for     THALOMID®     worldwide.     SALES AND     COMMERCIALIZATION         We have a global pharmaceutical commercial organization that has     considerable experience in the pharmaceutical industry, and many     of our employees have experience with oncological and     immunological products. We will continue to expand our sales and     commercialization group to support products we develop to treat     oncological and immunological diseases. We intend to market and     sell the products we develop for indications with accessible     patient populations. For products with indications involving     larger patient        13    Table of Contents       populations, we may partner with other pharmaceutical companies.     In addition, we are positioned to accelerate the expansion of     these sales and marketing resources as appropriate to take     advantage of product in-licensing and product acquisition     opportunities.     EMPLOYEES         As of December 31, 2007, we had 1,685 full-time     employees, 921 of whom were engaged primarily in research and     development activities, 428 who were engaged in sales and     commercialization activities and the remainder of which were     engaged in executive and general and administrative activities.     The number of international full-time employees included above     has grown to 436 as of December 31, 2007. We also employ a     number of part-time employees and maintain consulting     arrangements with a number of researchers at various     universities and other research institutions in Europe and the     United States.     FORWARD-LOOKING     STATEMENTS         Certain statements contained or incorporated by reference in     this Annual Report are forward-looking statements concerning our     business, results of operations, economic performance and     financial condition based on our current expectations.     Forward-looking statements within the meaning of     Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and within the     meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of     1934 are included, for example, in the discussions about:                         strategy;                    new product discovery, development or product introduction;                    product manufacturing;                    product sales, royalties and contract revenues;                    expenses and net income;                    credit risk management;                    liquidity;                    asset and liability risk management; and                    operational and legal risks.           These and other forward-looking statement are not guarantees of     future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that     could cause actual results to differ materially from those     implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these risks     and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance     on any forward-looking statements.         You can identify these forward-looking statements by their use     of words such as forecast, project,     plan, strategy, intend,     potential, outlook, target,     seek, continue, believe,     could, estimate, expect,     may, probable, should,     will or other words of similar meaning in     conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future     operations, financial performance, our strategy for growth,     product development, regulatory approval and market position.     You also can identify them by the fact that they do not relate     strictly to historical or current facts.         Reference is made, in particular, to forward-looking statements     regarding the results of current or pending clinical trials, our     products ability to demonstrate efficacy or an acceptable     safety profile, actions by the FDA, the financial conditions of     suppliers including their solvency and ability to supply     product, and other factors detailed in Item 1A. Risk     Factors and Managements Discussion and     Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     We note these factors as permitted by the Private Securities     Litigation Reform Act of 1995.         Except as required under the federal securities laws and the     rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,     we disclaim and do not undertake any obligations to update or     revise publicly any        14    Table of Contents       forward-looking statements in this report, whether as a result     of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or     otherwise.           Item 1A.     RISK     FACTORS       We may     experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating     results.         We have historically experienced, and may continue to     experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating     results. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many     of which are outside our control, and may result in volatility     of our stock price. Future operating results will depend on many     factors, including:                         demand for our products;                    pricing decisions, and those of our competitors, including     decisions to increase or decrease prices;                    regulatory approvals for our products;                    timing and levels of spending for research and development;     sales and marketing;                    timing and levels of reimbursement from third-party payors for     our products;                    timing and market acceptance of new product introductions by us     and/or     competitors;                    development or expansion of business infrastructure in new     clinical and geographic markets;                    acquisition of new products and companies;                    tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;                    timing and recognition of certain research and development     milestones and license fees;                    ability to control our costs; and                    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.       If we     are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing our products,     our business, financial condition, results of operations and     liquidity could be materially adversely affected which could     have a negative impact on the value of our     securities.         Many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid-stages of     research and development and will require the commitment of     substantial financial resources, extensive research,     development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing     scale-up and     regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale. Moreover, our     commercially available products may require additional studies     with respect to approved indications as well as new indications     pending approval. If it becomes too expensive to sustain our     present commitment of resources on a long-term basis, we will be     unable to continue certain necessary research and development     activities. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our clinical     testing will render satisfactory results, or that we will     receive required regulatory approvals for our new products or     new indications. If any of our products, even if developed and     approved, cannot be successfully commercialized, our business,     financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could     be materially adversely affected which could have a negative     impact on the value of our common stock or debt securities     obligations.     During     the next several years, we will be very dependent on the     continued commercial success of our primary products     REVLIMID® and     THALOMID®.         During the next several years, the growth of our business will     be largely dependent on the commercial success of     REVLIMID®     and our other products.     REVLIMID®     was approved by the FDA, EC, Swissmedic and Australia for     treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma     patients who have received at least one prior therapy. In     addition,     REVLIMID®     was approved by the FDA and Canada for treatment of patients     with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or     intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q     cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic     abnormalities. We do not have long-term data on the use of the     product and cannot predict whether     REVLIMID®     will continue to gain the acceptance        15    Table of Contents       of regulators, physicians, patients and other key opinion     leaders as a relatively safe and effective drug that has certain     advantages as compared to existing or future therapies. We are     also seeking to introduce     REVLIMID®     in additional international markets as well as obtaining     approvals for additional indications both in the U.S. and     internationally. A delay in gaining the requisite regulatory     approvals could negatively impact our growth plans and the value     of our common stock or debt securities obligations.         THALOMID®     in combination with dexamethasone was approved by FDA in May     2006 for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple     myeloma. In addition,     THALOMID®     is currently approved as a therapy for the treatment of ENL,     although the market for the use of     THALOMID®     in patients suffering from ENL is very small. If unexpected     adverse experiences are reported in connection with the use of     THALOMID®     by patients, this could undermine physician and patient comfort     with the product, could limit the commercial success of the     product and could even impact the acceptance of our other     products, including     REVLIMID®.         Our revenues and profits would be negatively impacted if adverse     experiences were reported in connection with any of these two     products or generic versions were to be approved and launched.     See We may not be able to protect our intellectual     property and our products may be subject to generic     competition for additional discussion related to     possible generic competition for     THALOMID®.     If our     products are not accepted by the market, demand for our products     will deteriorate or not materialize at all.         It is necessary that     REVLIMID®,     THALOMID®,     ALKERAN®,     FOCALINtm     and FOCALIN     XRtm,     and the     RITALIN®     family of drugs achieve and maintain market acceptance. A number     of factors can render the degree of market acceptance of our     products uncertain, including the products efficacy,     safety and advantages, if any, over competing products, as well     as the reimbursement policies of third-party payors, such as     government and private insurance plans. In particular,     thalidomide, when used by pregnant women, has resulted in     serious birth defects, and the negative history associated with     thalidomide and birth defects may decrease the market acceptance     of     THALOMID®.     In addition, the stem cell products that we are attempting to     develop through our Celgene Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary may     represent substantial departures from established treatment     methods and will compete with a number of traditional products     and therapies which are now, or may be in the future,     manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and     biopharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, public attitudes may     be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe, and     stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or     the medical community. If our products are not accepted by the     market, demand for our products will deteriorate or not     materialize at all.     We     have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that     growth our business could be adversely impacted.         We have an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial     and increasing investments in research and development, sales     and marketing, and facilities. We plan to continue to grow and     our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot control.     For example:                         we will need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level     of operating expenses (including clinical trial costs, expenses     associated with the regulatory approval process and     commercialization of our products), and our ability to do so may     depend on factors that we do not control;                    we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and     faster growing multinational organization; and                    we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we     manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing, marketing and     distribution capacity, and our ability to do so may depend on     factors that we do not control.       If the     third parties upon whom we rely fail to produce on a timely     basis the encapsulation, finishing and packaging services in the     volumes that we require or fail to meet quality standards and     maintain         16    Table of Contents   necessary licensure from regulatory authorities, we may be     unable to meet demand for our products, potentially resulting in     lost revenues.         We have contracted with third party manufacturers to provide     encapsulation, finishing services and packaging to meet our     needs. We intend to continue to utilize third parties as needed     to produce certain of our products on a commercial scale.         The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for     THALOMID®     is primarily obtained from our Zofingen, Switzerland,     manufacturing facility and from Aptuit, Inc. Two additional     suppliers are currently progressing through the qualification     process. With regard to drug product manufacturing, we rely on     two manufacturing service providers, Penn Pharmaceuticals     Services Limited and Institute of Drug Technology Australia     Limited, for the formulation and encapsulation of the finished     dosage form of     THALOMID®     capsules, and on one contract packager, Sharp Corporation, for     the packaging of the final product.         The API for     REVLIMID®     is manufactured primarily by our Zofingen, Switzerland,     manufacturing facility and by Aptuit Inc. UK (previously     Evotec). We have also contracted and registered two     manufacturing service providers, Penn Pharmaceuticals Services     Limited and OSG Norwich Pharmaceuticals, for the formulation and     encapsulation of the finished dosage form of     REVLIMID®     capsules. Sharp and Norwich are the contractors approved for     supplying the packaging for the final product in the     U.S. and Sharp, located in the U.S., and Cimex AG located     in Liesberg, Switzerland for the     non-U.S. supply.         The API for     FOCALINtm     is currently obtained from two suppliers, Johnson Matthey Inc.     and Siegfried USA, Inc., and we rely on a single manufacturer,     Mikart, Inc., for the tableting and packaging of     FOCALINtm     finished product. The API for FOCALIN     XRtm     is supplied by both Siegfried and Johnson Matthey Inc. on behalf     of Novartis for the manufacture of FOCALIN     XRtm.         In all the countries where we sell our products, governmental     regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing,     packaging, labeling and storing. All of our suppliers of raw     materials and contract manufacturers must comply with these     regulations. Failure to do so could result in supply     interruptions. In the United States, the FDA requires that all     suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk material and all manufacturers     of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the United States achieve     and maintain compliance with the FDAs cGMP regulations and     guidelines. Failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply     with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being     imposed on them or us, including fines, injunctions, civil     penalties, disgorgement, suspension or withdrawal of approvals,     license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating     restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could     significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. In     addition, before any product batch produced by our manufacturers     can be shipped, it must conform to release specifications     pre-approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical     product. If the operations of one or more of our manufacturers     were to become unavailable for any reason, any required FDA     review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier     could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products. If our     outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for quality,     quantity or timeliness, or do not achieve and maintain     compliance with all applicable regulations, demand for our     products or our ability to continue supplying such products     could substantially decline.     We are     in the process of establishing foreign marketing and     distribution capabilities.         We are establishing marketing and distribution capabilities in     international markets with respect to our products. At the same     time, we are in the process of obtaining necessary governmental     and regulatory approvals to sell our products in certain     countries. If we have not successfully completed and implemented     adequate marketing and distribution support services upon our     receipt of such approvals, our ability to effectively launch our     products in these countries would be severely restricted. In     addition, we have contracted with Ivers Lee Corporation, d/b/a     Sharp, a specialty distributor, to distribute     THALOMID®     and     REVLIMID®     in the United States. If Sharp does not perform its obligations,     our ability to distribute     THALOMID®     and     REVLIMID®     in the United States may be impacted for a limited period of     time.        17    Table of Contents   We     have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pharmion,     subject to certain closing conditions, including the appropriate     affirmative vote of Pharmion stockholders. The integration of     Pharmion and other acquired businesses may present significant     challenges to us.         Achieving the anticipated benefits of our pending acquisition of     Pharmion will depend in part upon whether we and Pharmion can     integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner.     In addition, we may acquire additional businesses from time to     time. The integration of Pharmion and any future businesses that     we may acquire involves a number of risks, including, but not     limited to:                         demands on management related to the increase in our size after     the acquisition;                    the diversion of managements attention from the management     of daily operations to the integration of operations;                    higher integration costs than anticipated;                    failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;                    difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;                    difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and     practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and     geographically dispersed personnel and operations; and                    difficulties in the integration of departments, systems,     including accounting systems, technologies, books and records,     and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards,     controls, including internal control over financial reporting     required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related     procedures and policies.           If we cannot successfully integrate Pharmion or other acquired     businesses, we may experience material negative consequences to     our business, financial condition or results of operations.     Successful integration of Pharmion and other acquired businesses     will depend on our ability to manage these operations, to     realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by offerings     and expanded geographic market coverage and, to some degree, to     eliminate redundant and excess costs. Because of difficulties in     combining geographically distant operations, we may not be able     to achieve the benefits that we hope to achieve as a result of     the merger with Pharmion or other acquired businesses.     We may     be unable to retain skilled personnel and maintain key     relationships.         The success of our business depends, in large part, on our     continued ability to (i) attract and retain highly     qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and sales and     marketing personnel, (ii) successfully integrate large     numbers of new employees into our corporate culture, and     (iii) develop and maintain important relationships with     leading research and medical institutions and key distributors.     Competition for these types of personnel and relationships is     intense. In particular, the success of the combined operations     after our pending acquisition of Pharmion will depend in part     upon our ability to retain key employees of Pharmion. Key     employees may depart because of issues relating to the     difficulty of integration or accelerated retirement as a result     of change in control severance provisions in their employment     agreements with Pharmion.         Among other benefits, we use stock options to attract and retain     personnel. Stock option accounting rules require us to recognize     all stock-based compensation costs as expenses. These or other     factors could reduce the number of shares management and our     board of directors grants under our stock option plans. We     cannot be sure that we will be able to attract or retain skilled     personnel or maintain key relationships, including key employees     of Pharmion, or that the costs of retaining such personnel or     maintaining such relationships will not materially increase.     The     hazardous materials we use in our research, development and     other business operations could result in significant     liabilities, which could exceed our insurance coverage and     financial resources.         We use certain hazardous materials in our research, development     and general business activities. While we believe we are     currently in substantial compliance with the federal, state and     local laws and regulations        18    Table of Contents       governing the use of these materials, we cannot be certain that     accidental injury or contamination will not occur. Any such     accident or contamination could result in substantial     liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and     financial resources. Additionally, the cost of compliance with     environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in     the future, requiring us to expend more financial resources     either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance     coverage.     The     pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive government     regulation which presents numerous risks to us.         The discovery, preclinical development, clinical trials,     manufacturing, marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and     biologics are all subject to extensive regulation by numerous     governmental authorities and agencies in the United States and     other countries. If we or our contractors and collaborators are     delayed in receiving, or are unable to obtain at all, necessary     governmental approvals, we will be unable to effectively market     our products.         The testing, marketing and manufacturing of our products require     regulatory approval, including approval from the FDA and, in     some cases, from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,     or the EPA, or governmental authorities outside of the United     States that perform roles similar to those of the FDA and EPA.     Certain of our pharmaceutical products, such as     FOCALINtm,     fall under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 that requires     authorization by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA,     of the U.S. Department of Justice in order to handle and     distribute these products. The regulatory approval process     presents several risks to us:                         In general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many     years, and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and     the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible     to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent     regulatory approval;                    Delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the     regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or     other data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure     of the product to meet, a regulatory agencys requirements     for safety, efficacy and quality or, in the case of a product     seeking an orphan drug indication, because another designee     received approval first or receives approval of other labeled     indications;                    Requirements for approval may become more stringent due to     changes in regulatory agency policy, or the adoption of new     regulations or legislation;                    The scope of any regulatory approval, when obtained, may     significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may     be marketed and reimbursed and may impose significant     limitations in the nature of warnings, precautions and     contra-indications that could materially affect the sales and     profitability of the drug;                    Pricing and reimbursement controls;                    Approved products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject     to continuing and ongoing review, and discovery of previously     unknown problems with these products or the failure to adhere to     manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in     restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their     withdrawal from the market;                    Regulatory authorities and agencies of the United States or     foreign governments may promulgate additional regulations     restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products;                    Guidelines and recommendations published by various     non-governmental organizations can reduce the use of our     products;                    Once a product receives marketing approval, we may not market     that product for broader or different applications, and the FDA     may not grant us approval with respect to separate product     applications that represent extensions of our basic technology.     In addition, the FDA may withdraw or modify existing approvals     in a significant manner or promulgate additional regulations     restricting the sale of our present          19    Table of Contents       or proposed products. The FDA may also request that we perform     additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our     existing or proposed products if we or others identify side     effects after our products are on the market;                         Products, such as     REVLIMID®,     that are subject to accelerated approval can be subject to an     expedited withdrawal if the post-marketing study commitments are     not completed with due diligence, the post-marketing     restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be inadequate to     assure the safe use of the drug, or evidence demonstrates that     the drug is not shown to be safe and effective under its     conditions of use. Additionally, promotional materials for such     products are subject to enhanced surveillance, including     pre-approval review of all promotional materials used within     120 days following marketing approval and a requirement for     the submissions 30 days prior to initial dissemination of     all promotional materials disseminated after 120 days     following marketing approval; and                    Our labeling and promotional activities relating to our products     are regulated by the FDA and state regulatory agencies and, in     some circumstances, by the DEA, and are subject to associated     risks. If we fail to comply with FDA regulations prohibiting     promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for     which marketing clearance has not been obtained, the FDA, or the     Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and     Human Services or the state Attorneys General could bring an     enforcement action against us that could inhibit our marketing     capabilities as well as result in significant penalties.           Additionally, the FDA approval process would allow for the     approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a generic     version of our approved products upon the expiration, through     passage of time or successful legal challenge, of relevant     patent or non-patent exclusivity protection. ANDAs and 505(b)(2)     applications are generally less burdensome than full NDAs in     that, in lieu of clinical data, these applications rely in     whole, or in part, upon the safety and efficacy findings of the     referenced approved product in conjunction with bridging data,     typically bioequivalence data.         The FDAs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research     currently regulates under 21 CFR Parts 1270 and 1271 human     tissue intended for transplantation that is recovered,     processed, stored or distributed by methods that do not change     tissue function or characteristics and that is not currently     regulated as a human drug, biological product or medical device.     Certain stem cell-related activities fall within this category.     Part 1270 requires tissue establishments to screen and test     donors, to prepare and follow written procedures for the     prevention of the spread of communicable disease and to maintain     records. It also provides for inspection by the FDA of tissue     establishments. Part 1271 requires human cells, tissue and     cellular and tissue-based product establishments (HCT/Ps) to     register with the agency and list their HCT/Ps.         Currently, we are required to be, and are, licensed to operate     in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware, four of the     states in which we currently collect placentas and umbilical     cord blood for our allogeneic and private stem cell banking     businesses, and we are in process of obtaining a license in the     state of California. If other states adopt similar licensing     requirements, we would need to obtain such licenses to continue     operating. If we are delayed in receiving, or are unable to     obtain at all, necessary licenses, we will be unable to provide     services in those states and this would impact negatively on our     revenues.     We may     not be able to protect our intellectual property and our     products may be subject to generic competition.         Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and     enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to     technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business     without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The     patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical firms,     including ours, can be uncertain and involve complex legal and     factual questions.         Under the current U.S. patent laws, patent applications     filed in the United States on or before November 28, 2000     are maintained in secrecy until patents issue. Patent     applications filed in the U.S. on or after     November 29, 2000 are not published until approximately     18 months after their earliest claimed priority date, and     publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent     literature often lag behind actual discoveries.        20    Table of Contents       Thus, we may discover sometime in the future that we, or the     third parties from whom we have licensed patents or patent     applications, were not the first to make     and/or file     the inventions covered by the patents and patent applications in     which we have or seek rights. In the event that a third party     has also filed a patent application for any of the inventions     claimed in our patents or patent applications, or those we have     licensed-in, we could become involved in an interference     proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark     Office, or the PTO, to determine priority of invention or an     opposition proceeding in other places such as Europe. Such an     interference or opposition could result in the loss of an issued     U.S. or foreign patent, respectively, or loss of any     opportunity to secure U.S. patent protection for that     invention. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, such     proceedings could result in substantial cost and delay to us and     limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.         In addition, the coverage sought in a patent application may not     be obtained or may be significantly reduced before the patent is     issued. Consequently, if our pending applications, or pending     application that we have licensed-in from third parties, do not     result in the issuance of patents or if any patents that are     issued do not provide significant proprietary protection or     commercial advantage, our ability to sustain the necessary level     of intellectual property rights upon which our success depends     may be restricted.         Moreover, different countries have different procedures for     obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries     provide different degrees of protection against the use of a     patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us     or our licensors, in a given country, of a patent covering an     invention is not followed by the issuance in other countries of     patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial     interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the     claims in a patent issued in one country is not similar to the     interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in     another country, our ability to protect our intellectual     property in other countries may be limited.         Furthermore, even if our patent applications, or those we have     licensed-in, are issued, our competitors may still challenge the     scope, validity or enforceability of such patents in court,     requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly     litigation. Alternatively, our competitors may be able to design     around such patents and compete with us using the resulting     alternative technology. If any of our issued or licensed patents     are infringed, we may not be successful in enforcing our or our     licensors intellectual property rights or defending the     validity or enforceability of our issued patents and     subsequently not be able to develop or market applicable product     exclusively.         We rely upon unpatented proprietary and trade secret technology     that we try to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements     with our collaborative partners, employees, consultants, outside     scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other     advisors. If these agreements are breached, we may not have     adequate remedies for any such breach. Despite precautions taken     by us, others may obtain access to or independently develop our     proprietary technology or such technology may be found to be     non-proprietary or not a trade secret.         Our right to practice the inventions claimed in certain patents     that relate to     THALOMID®     arises under licenses granted to us by others, including The     Rockefeller University and Childrens Medical Center     Corporation, or CMCC. In addition to these patents, which relate     to thalidomide, we have also licensed from CMCC certain patents     relating to thalidomide analogs. In December 2002, we entered     into an exclusive license agreement with CMCC and EntreMed Inc.     pursuant to which CMCC exclusively licensed to us certain     patents and patent applications that relate to analogs,     metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products of thalidomide,     and all stereoisomers thereof. Our license under the December     2002 agreement is worldwide and royalty-bearing, and we have     complete control over the prosecution of the licensed     thalidomide analog patent rights. Under this December 2002     agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain milestones     for a     REVLIMID®     approval and royalties with respect to sales of     REVLIMID®.     The December 2002 agreement also grants us an option for a     certain time period to inventions in the field of thalidomide     analogs that may be developed at CMCC in the laboratory of     Dr. Robert DAmato, pursuant to the terms and     conditions of a separate Sponsored Research Agreement negotiated     between CMCC and us.         Further, while we believe these confidentiality agreements and     license agreements to be valid and enforceable, our rights under     these agreements may not continue or disputes concerning these     agreements may        21    Table of Contents       arise. If any of the foregoing should occur, we may be unable to     rely upon our unpatented proprietary and trade secret     technology, or we may be unable to use the third-party     proprietary technology we have licensed-in, either of which may     prevent or hamper us from successfully pursuing our business.         It is also possible that third-party patent applications and     patents could issue with claims that broadly cover certain     aspects of our business or of the subject matter claimed in the     patents or patent applications owned or optioned by us or     licensed to us, which may limit our ability to conduct our     business or to practice under our patents, and may impede our     efforts to obtain meaningful patent protection of our own. If     patents are issued to third parties that contain competitive or     conflicting claims, we may be legally prohibited from pursuing     research, development or commercialization of potential products     or be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop     or obtain alternative technology. We may be legally prohibited     from using patented technology, may not be able to obtain any     license to the patents and technologies of third parties on     acceptable terms, if at all, or may not be able to obtain or     develop alternative technologies. Consequently, if we cannot     successfully defend against any patent infringement suit that     may be brought against us by a third-party, we may lose the     ability to continue to conduct our business as we presently do,     or to practice certain subject matter delineated by patent     claims that we have exclusive rights to, whether by ownership or     by license, and that may have a material adverse effect on our     business.         We rely upon trademarks and service marks to protect our rights     to the intellectual property used in our business.     Litigation     on a variety of matters may subject us to significant legal     expenses and liability.         From time to time, we may be subject to litigation on a variety     of matters, including, as discussed above, intellectual     property, licensing arrangements with other persons and product     liability. Litigation requires the expenditure of significant     time and resources, and is inherently unpredictable. If any     litigation were to have an unanticipated adverse result, there     could be a material impact on our results of operations or     financial position.     The     pharmaceutical and biotech industry is highly competitive and     subject to rapid and significant technological     change.         The pharmaceutical industry in which we operate is highly     competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological     change. Our present and potential competitors include major     pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as specialty     pharmaceutical firms, including but not limited to:                         Amgen, which potentially competes with our TNF-α and kinase     inhibitors;                    Novartis, which potentially competes with our     IMiDs®     compounds and kinase programs;                    Bristol Myers Squibb Co., which potentially competes in clinical     trials with our     IMiDs®     compounds and TNF-α inhibitors;                    Genentech, Inc., which potentially competes in clinical trials     with our     IMiDs®     compounds and TNF-α inhibitors;                    AstraZeneca plc, which potentially competes in clinical trials     with our     IMiDs®     compounds and TNF-α inhibitors;                    Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Johnson & Johnson,     which compete with     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®     in the treatment of multiple myeloma and in clinical trials with     our     IMiDs®     compounds;                    Pfizer Inc., which potentially competes in clinical trials with     our kinase inhibitors;                    Biogen Idec Inc. and Genzyme Corporation, both of which are     generally developing drugs that address the oncology and     immunology markets; and                    Johnson & Johnson, which potentially competes with     certain of our proprietary programs including our oral     anti-inflammatory programs.          22    Table of Contents         Many of these companies have considerably greater financial,     technical and marketing resources than we do. We also experience     competition from universities and other research institutions,     and in some instances, we compete with others in acquiring     technology from these sources. The pharmaceutical industry has     undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and     significant technological change, and we expect competition to     intensify as technical advances in the field are made and become     more widely known. The development of products, including     generics, or processes by our competitors with significant     advantages over those that we are seeking to develop could cause     the marketability of our products to stagnate or decline.     Sales     of our products are dependent on third-party     reimbursement.         Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to     which the costs of our products will be paid by health     maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health     care management organizations, or reimbursed by government     health administration authorities, private health coverage     insurers and other third-party payors. These health care     management organizations and third-party payors are increasingly     challenging the prices charged for medical products and     services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has     become a priority of federal and state governments, and the     prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. If these     organizations and third-party payors do not consider our     products to be cost-effective compared to other available     therapies, they may not reimburse providers or consumers of our     products or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be     sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable     basis.     Changes     in our effective income tax rate could impact our     earnings.         Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our     effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not     limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, the accounting     for stock options and other share-based payments, changes in tax     laws and rates, future levels of research and development     spending, changes in accounting standards, future levels of     capital expenditures, changes in the mix of earnings in the     various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, the outcome of     IRS exams and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. The     impact on our income tax provision resulting from the     above-mentioned factors may be significant and could have an     impact on our results of operations.     Our     operations may be impacted by currency fluctuations that may     cause our earnings to fluctuate.         Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against     foreign currencies could impact our earnings. We anticipate     utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign     currency risk and not to engage in currency speculation. We     would use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted     transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging     efforts would reduce but not eliminate our anticipated exposure     to currency fluctuations. Any significant foreign exchange rate     fluctuations within a short period of time could still adversely     affect our financial condition and results of operations.     We may     experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet     our financial reporting obligations.         As our Company continues to expand at a rapid pace, the     development of new and improvements to existing automated     systems will remain an ongoing priority. During this expansion     period, our internal control over financial reporting may not     prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting. Such     misstatements may result in litigation     and/or     negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction     that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our     common stock or debt securities obligations.     The     price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may     make it difficult for you to sell the common stock when you want     or at prices you find attractive.         There has been significant volatility in the market prices for     publicly traded shares of biopharmaceutical companies, including     ours. We expect that the market price of our common stock will     continue to fluctuate. The     intra-day     price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $75.44 per     share to a low of $41.26 per share in 2007. On December 31,     2007, our common stock closed at a price of $46.21 per share.     The price of        23    Table of Contents       our common stock may not remain at or exceed current levels. The     following key factors may have an adverse impact on the market     price of our common stock:                         results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with     our marketed products;                    announcements of technical or product developments by our     competitors;                    market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks;                    market conditions generally;                    governmental regulation;                    new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings;                    health care legislation;                    public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment     of the disease states that we are targeting;                    patent or proprietary rights developments;                    changes in pricing and third-party reimbursement policies for     our products;                    fluctuations in our operating results;                    the outcome of litigation involving our products or processes     related to production and formulation of those products or uses     of those products;                    competition;                    investor reaction to announcements regarding business or product     acquisitions.           The market price of our common stock may also decline as a     result of the pending acquisition of Pharmion if the integration     with Pharmion is unsuccessful or takes longer than expected; the     perceived benefits of the merger are not achieved as rapidly as     anticipated or, to the extent anticipated, by financial analysts     or investors; or the effect of the merger on our financial     results is not consistent with the expectations of financial     analysts or investors.         In addition, the stock market in general and the biotechnology     sector in particular has experienced extreme volatility that has     often been unrelated to the operating performance of a     particular company. These broad market fluctuations may     adversely affect the market price of our common stock.     The     number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale     could adversely affect the market price of our common     stock.         Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or debt     or other securities convertible into common stock could     adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of     December 31, 2007, there were outstanding stock options and     warrants for 33,096,086 shares of common stock, of which     22,320,094 were currently vested and exercisable at an exercise     price between $0.04 per share and $73.55 per share, with a     weighted average exercise price of $18.97 per share. In     addition, in June 2003, we issued $400.0 million of     unsecured convertible notes that are currently convertible into     16,227,441 shares of our common stock at the conversion     price of $12.1125. These notes will mature in June 2008. The     conversion of some or all of these notes will dilute the     ownership interest of our stockholders. In addition, we will     issue between 24,000,000 and 32,000,000 shares of our     common stock in the merger, all of which may be immediately     resold.     Our     shareholder rights plan and certain charter and by-law     provisions may deter a third-party from acquiring us and may     impede the stockholders ability to remove and replace our     management or board of directors.         Our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan,     the purpose of which is to protect stockholders against     unsolicited attempts to acquire control of us that do not offer     a fair price to all of our        24    Table of Contents       stockholders. The rights plan may have the effect of dissuading     a potential acquirer from making an offer for our common stock     at a price that represents a premium to the then current trading     price.         Our board of directors has the authority to issue, at any time,     without further stockholder approval, up to     5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the     price, rights, privileges and preferences of those shares. An     issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third-party from     acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock.     Additionally, our board of directors has adopted certain     amendments to our by-laws intended to strengthen the     boards position in the event of a hostile takeover     attempt. These provisions could impede the stockholders     ability to remove and replace our management     and/or board     of directors.         Furthermore, we are subject to the provisions of     Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an     anti-takeover law, which may also dissuade a potential acquirer     of our common stock.

ITEM 1B.     UNRESOLVED     STAFF COMMENTS           None.           ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES           Our corporate headquarters, which is located in Summit, New     Jersey on approximately 45 acres of land, was purchased in     2004 and consists of several buildings, which house our     administrative, sales, marketing and research functions.         Construction of our international headquarters in Neuchatel,     Switzerland was completed in 2007 and includes a drug product     manufacturing facility to perform formulation, encapsulation,     packaging, warehousing and distribution. In December 2006, we     purchased an API manufacturing facility located in Zofingen,     Switzerland which has the capability to produce multiple drug     substances. The facility is being used to produce     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®     API to supply global markets and may also be used to produce     drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates.         We occupy the following facilities under operating lease     arrangements that have remaining lease terms greater than     one-year. Under these lease arrangements, we also are required     to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance,     utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. All leases are     with unaffiliated parties.                         73,500-square feet of laboratory and office space in Warren, New     Jersey. The two leases for this facility extend through May 2012     and July 2010, respectively, and contain five-year renewal     options. Annual rent for these facilities is approximately     $1.1 million.                    78,200-square feet of laboratory and office space in     San Diego, California. The lease for this facility has a     term ending in August 2012 with one five-year renewal option.     Annual rent for this facility is approximately $2.1 million     and is subject to specified annual rental increases.                    20,800-square feet of office and laboratory space in Cedar     Knolls, New Jersey. The lease for this facility has a term     ending at the end of October 2010 with renewal options for     additional five-year terms. Annual rent for this facility is     approximately $0.3 million and is subject to specified     annual rental increases.          25    Table of Contents                         11,000-square feet of office and laboratory space in Baton     Rouge, Louisiana. The lease for this facility has a term ending     in May 2011. Annual rent for this facility is approximately     $0.1 million.           We also lease a number of offices under various lease agreements     in Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan. The minimum annual rents     may be subject to specified annual rent increases. At     December 31, 2007, the non-cancelable lease terms for these     operating leases expire at various dates between 2008 and 2016     and in some cases include renewal options.           ITEM 3.     LEGAL     PROCEEDINGS           Barr Laboratories, Inc., (Barr) a generic drug     manufacturer located in Pomona, New York, filed an ANDA for the     treatment of ENL in the manner described in our label and     seeking permission from the FDA to market a generic version of     50mg, 100mg and 200mg     THALOMID®.     Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic     manufacturer may file an ANDA with a certification (a     Paragraph IV certification) challenging the     validity or infringement of a patent listed in the FDAs     Orange Book four years after the pioneer company obtains     approval of its New Drug Application, or an NDA. On or after     December 5, 2006, Barr mailed notices of Paragraph IV     certifications alleging that the following patents listed for     THALOMID®     in the Orange Book are invalid, unenforceable,     and/or not     infringed: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,045,501 (the 501     patent), 6,315,720 (the 720 patent),     6,561,976 (the 976 patent), 6,561,977     (the 977 patent), 6,755,784 (the     784 patent), 6,869,399 (the 399     patent), 6,908,432 (the 432 patent), and     7,141,018 (the 018 patent). The 501,     976, and 432 patents do not expire until     August 28, 2018, while the remaining patents do not expire     until October 23, 2020. On January 18, 2007, we filed     an infringement action in the United States District Court of     New Jersey against Barr. By bringing suit, we are entitled up to     a maximum     30-month     stay, from the date of Celgenes receipt of a     Paragraph IV certification, against the FDAs approval     of a generic applicants application to market a generic     version of     THALOMID®.     In June 2007, United States Patent No. 7,230,012, or     012 patent, was issued to us claiming formulations of     thalidomide and was then timely listed in the Orange Book. Barr     sent us a supplemental Paragraph IV certification against     the 012 patent and alleged that the claims of the     012 patent, directed to formulations which encompass     THALOMID®,     were invalid. On August 23, 2007, we filed an infringement     action in the United States District Court of New Jersey with     respect to the 012 patent. On or after October 4,     2007, Barr filed a second supplemental notice of     Paragraph IV certifications relating to the 150mg dosage     strength of     THALOMID®     alleging that the 501 patent, 720 patent, 976     patent, 977 patent, 784 patent, 399 patent,     432 patent and the 018 patent are invalid,     unenforceable,     and/or not     infringed. On November 14, 2007, we filed an infringement     action in the United States District Court of New Jersey against     Barr. All three actions have subsequently been consolidated. We     intend to enforce our patent rights. If the ANDA is approved by     the FDA, and Barr is successful in challenging our patents     listed in the Orange Book for     THALOMID®,     Barr would be permitted to sell a generic thalidomide product.         On August 19, 2004, we, together with our exclusive     licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United     States District Court of New Jersey against Teva Pharmaceuticals     USA, Inc., (Teva) in response to notices of     Paragraph IV certifications made by Teva in connection with     the filing of an ANDA for     FOCALIN®.     The notification letters from Teva contend that United States     Patent Nos. 5,908,850, or 850 patent, and 6,355,656, or     656 patent, are invalid. After the suit was filed,     Novartis listed another patent, United States Patent     No. 6,528,530, or 530 patent, in the Orange Book in     association with the     FOCALIN®     NDA. The original 2004 action asserted infringement of the     850 patent. Teva amended its answer during discovery to     contend that the 850 patent was not infringed by the     filing of its ANDA, and that the 850 patent is not     enforceable due to an allegation of inequitable conduct. Fact     discovery in the original 2004 action expired on     February 28, 2006. At about the time of the filing of the     850 patent infringement action, reexamination proceedings     for the 656 patent were initiated in the U.S. PTO. On     September 28, 2006, the U.S. PTO issued a Notice of     Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate, and on     March 27, 2007, the Reexamination Certificate for the     656 patent issued. On December 21, 2006, Celgene and     Novartis filed an action in the United States District Court of     New Jersey against Teva for infringement of the 656     patent. Teva filed an amended answer and counterclaim on     March 23, 2007. The amended counterclaim seeks a     declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and     unenforceability. The statutory     30-month     stay of FDA approval of Tevas ANDA expired on     January 9, 2007, and Teva proceeded to market with a     generic version        26    Table of Contents       of     FOCALIN®.     Novartis sales of     FOCALIN®     have been significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic     FOCALIN®     product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties     associated with these sales. A claim has been made for damages     resulting from Tevas sales and for a permanent injunction     prohibiting future sales by Teva. The parties currently are     engaged in fact discovery with respect to the 656 patent     and other issues related to Tevas product launch. No trial     date has been set. The 530 patent is not part of this     patent infringement action against Teva.         On September 14, 2007, we, together with our exclusive     licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United     States District Court for the District of New Jersey against     Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. in response to a notice of a     Paragraph IV certification made by Teva in connection with     the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN     XR®.     The notification letter from Teva contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,908,850 and 6,528,530 are invalid,     unenforceable, and not infringed by the proposed Teva products,     and it contends that United States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and     6,635,284 are invalid and not infringed by the proposed Teva     products. Celgene and Novartis asserted each of these patents     and additionally asserted United States Patent     No. 6,355,656 in their complaint against Teva. Teva filed     an answer and counterclaim on November 5, 2007. The     counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity,     noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect to the     patents-in-suit.     No trial date has been set. If we are unsuccessful in proving     infringement or defending our patents, Novartis sales of     FOCALIN     XR®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic FOCALIN     XR®     product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties     associated with these sales.         On October 5, 2007, we, together with our exclusive     licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United     States District Court for the District of New Jersey against     IntelliPharmaCeutics Corp. (IPC) in response to a     notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by IPC in     connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN     XR®.     The notification letter from IPC contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are not     infringed by the proposed IPC products. The notification letter     also contends that claims in United States Patent Nos.     5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are     invalid, and that claims in United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850,     6,355,656 and 6,528,530 are unenforceable. In their complaint     against IPC, Celgene and Novartis asserted United States Patent     Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284.     IPC filed an answer and counterclaim on November 20, 2007.     The counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent     invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect     to Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, and 6,528,530, and it seeks     a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and noninfringement     with respect to Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. No pretrial     or trial dates have been set. If we are unsuccessful in proving     infringement or defending our patents, Novartis sales of     FOCALIN     XR®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic FOCALIN     XR®     product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties     associated with these sales.         On November 8, 2007, we, together with our exclusive     licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United     States District Court for the District of New Jersey against     Actavis South Atlantic LLC and Abrika Pharmaceuticals, Inc.     (collectively, Abrika) in response to a notice of a     Paragraph IV certification made by Abrika in connection     with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN     XR®.     The notification letter from Abrika contends that claims in     United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 5,837,284, and     6,635,284 are not infringed by the proposed Abrika products, and     it contends that claims in United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850,     6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid. In     their complaint against Abrika, Celgene and Novartis asserted     United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530,     5,837,284, and 6,635,284. No pretrial or trial dates have been     set. If we are unsuccessful in proving infringement or defending     our patents, Novartis sales of FOCALIN     XR®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic FOCALIN     XR®     product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties     associated with these sales.         On November 16, 2007, we, together with our exclusive     licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United     States District Court for the District of New Jersey against     Barr Laboratories, Inc. and Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in     response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made     by Barr in connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN     XR®.     The notification letter from Barr contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 5,837,284, and     6,635,284 are not infringed by the proposed Barr products, and     it contends that claims in United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850,     6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid. In     their complaint against Barr, Celgene and Novartis asserted     United States Patent        27    Table of Contents       Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284.     No pretrial or trial dates have been set. If we are unsuccessful     in proving infringement or defending our patents, Novartis     sales of FOCALIN     XR®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic FOCALIN     XR®     product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties     associated with these sales.         On December 4, 2006, we, together with our exclusive     licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United     States District Court for the District of New Jersey against     Abrika Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Abrika Pharmaceuticals, LLP, in     response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made     by Abrika in connection with the filing of an ANDA for RITALIN     LA®,     20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg generic products. The     notification letter from Abrika contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid and are     not infringed by the proposed Abrika products. In their     complaint against Abrika, Celgene and Novartis asserted United     States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. Abrika filed an     answer and counterclaim in the New Jersey court on June 1,     2007. The counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent     invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect     to the     patents-in-suit.     On September 26, 2007, Abrika sent a Paragraph IV     certification to Celgene and Novartis in connection with the     filing of an ANDA supplement with respect to Abrikas     proposed generic 10 mg RITALIN     LA®     product. Celgene and Novartis filed an amended complaint against     Abrika on November 5, 2007 that includes infringement     allegations directed to Abrikas proposed generic     10 mg RITALIN     LA®     product. Abrika filed an answer and counterclaim to the amended     complaint on December 5, 2007. The counterclaim seeks a     declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and     unenforceability with respect to the     patents-in-suit.     No trial date has been set. The parties are currently engaged in     fact discovery with a current fact discovery deadline of     February 22, 2008. If we are unsuccessful in proving     infringement or defending our patents, Novartis sales of     RITALIN     LA®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic RITALIN     LA®     product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties     associated with these sales.         On October 4, 2007, we, together with our exclusive     licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United     States District Court for the District of New Jersey against KV     Pharmaceutical Company (KV) in response to a notice     of a Paragraph IV certification made by KV in connection     with the filing of an ANDA for RITALIN     LA®.     The notification letter from KV contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are not infringed by     the proposed KV products. In their complaint against KV, Celgene     and Novartis asserted United States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and     6,635,284. KV filed an answer and counterclaim on     November 26, 2007. The counterclaim seeks a declaratory     judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and     unenforceability with respect to the     patents-in-suit.     No pretrial or trial dates have been set. If we are unsuccessful     in proving infringement or defending our patents, Novartis     sales of RITALIN     LA®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic RITALIN     LA®     product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties     associated with these sales.         On October 31, 2007, we, together with our exclusive     licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United     States District Court for the District of New Jersey against     Barr Laboratories, Inc. and Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in     response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made     by Barr in connection with the filing of an ANDA for RITALIN     LA®.     The notification letter from Barr contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid and not     infringed by the proposed Barr products. In their complaint     against Barr, Celgene and Novartis asserted United States Patent     Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. No pretrial or trial dates have     been set. If we are unsuccessful in proving infringement or     defending our patents, Novartis sales of RITALIN     LA®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic RITALIN     LA®     product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties     associated with these sales.         On October 29, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against Centocor,     Inc. to prevent Centocors use of the term     I.M.I.D.s in connection with Centocors     products, which use, we believe, is likely to cause confusion     with our     IMiDs®     registered trademark for compounds (including     REVLIMID®)     developed or being developed by us to treat cancer and     inflammatory diseases. In 2007, we settled the case and Centocor     agreed to stop using the term I.M.I.D.s.           ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS       Introduction         Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively     we or our) is a global biopharmaceutical     company primarily engaged in the discovery, development and     commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat     cancer and immune-inflammatory related diseases. Our primary     commercial stage products include     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®.     REVLIMID®     is an oral immunomodulatory drug approved by the FDA, the     European Commission, or EC, Swissmedic and the Australian     Therapeutic Goods Administration for treatment in combination     with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have     received at least one prior therapy.     REVLIMID®     is also approved by the FDA and Canadian Therapeutic Products     Directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent     anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS, associated with a     deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional     cytogenetic abnormalities.     THALOMID®     was approved by the FDA in combination with dexamethasone for     the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and for the     treatment of acute cutaneous manifestations of moderate to     severe erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, and as maintenance     therapy for prevention and suppression of the cutaneous     manifestation of ENL recurrence. Over the past several years, we     have made substantial investments in research and development     and the drug candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of     preclinical and clinical development. These candidates include     our     IMiDs®     compounds, which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and     having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important     properties in addition to our leading oral anti-inflammatory     agents. We believe that our primary commercial stage products     and depth of our product pipeline provide the catalysts for our     future growth.     Factors     Affecting Future Results         Future operating results will depend on many factors, including     demand for our products, regulatory approvals of our products     and product candidates, the timing and market acceptance of new     products launched        32    Table of Contents       by us or competing companies, the timing of research and     development milestones, challenges to our intellectual property     and our ability to control costs. See also the Risk Factors     discussion contained in Part I, Item 1A. Some of the     more signficant factors that we are focused on include: the     ability of     REVLIMID®     to successfully penetrate and expand in relevant markets, our     ability to advance clinical and regulatory programs and     competitive risks.     The ability of     REVLIMID®     to successfully penetrate and expand in relevant     markets:  The introduction of     REVLIMID®     in the United States has included among other things,     registering physicians in the     RevAssist®     program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution     program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of     REVLIMID®     and partnering with contracted pharmacies to ensure, to the     maximum extent possible, safe and rapid distribution of     REVLIMID®.     In international markets,     REVLIMID®     was granted approval by the European Commission, Swissmedic,     Canadian Therapeutic Products Directorate and Australian     Therapeutic Goods Administration with product launches already     initiated in several of the approved countries. We are also     continuing to work with the appropriate regulatory authorities     to determine next steps for pricing, reimbursement and     distribution in those countries in which     REVLIMID®     has not yet been launched. We do not have long-term data on the     use of     REVLIMID®     and cannot predict whether     REVLIMID®     will continue to gain widespread acceptance from regulators,     physicians, patients, opinion leaders, government health     agencies and private health plans.     The ability to advance regulatory and clinical     programs:  A Marketing Authorization Application,     or MAA, seeking approval to market     REVLIMID®     for treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia due to     low-or-intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated     with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without     additional cytogenetic abnormalities was evaluated by the     European Medicines Agencys, or EMEA, Committee for     Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP and a negative opinion     issued in January 2008. The CHMP concluded that lenalidomide is     efficacious in patients suffering from deletion 5q MDS. Based on     information available to the CHMP from the uncontrolled,     open-label, 148-patient Phase II study (MDS-003), the CHMP     was not convinced the data were sufficient to assure safety. We     intend to apply for a reexamination of the CHMP opinion in     accordance with relevant EMEA procedures. Other international     regulatory initiatives include MAAs under evaluation in     New Zealand and Israel.         In April 2007, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group reported     that its Data Monitoring Committees review of preliminary     results from a large, randomized clinical trial for patients     with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma found that the use of a     low-dose of dexamethasone in combination with     REVLIMID®     suggests survival advantage for patients when compared to the     higher, standard-dose of dexamethasone that is used in     combination with     REVLIMID®     to treat the disease. These results were also presented at the     June 2007 annual American Society of Clinical Oncology medical     conference and updated at the December 2007 annual American     Society of Hematology meeting. The regulatory utility of these     findings will be discussed with the FDA.         A major objective of our on-going clinical programs is to     broaden our knowledge about the full potential of     REVLIMID®     and our other proprietary     IMiDs®     compounds and to continue to evaluate them in a broad range of     hematological malignancies and other cancers. Our near-term     focus is on evaluating     REVLIMID®     as a treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and     aggressive non-Hodgkins lymphomas, or NHL. In November     2007,     REVLIMID®     was granted orphan medicinal product designation by the EC for     treatment of CLL.     Competitive Risks:  While competition could     limit     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®     sales, we do not believe that competing products would eliminate     their use entirely. Moreover, while generic competitors could     seek to challenge our     THALOMID®     franchise, we own intellectual property which includes, for     example, U.S. patents covering our     S.T.E.P.S.®     distribution program for the safe distribution and appropriate     use of thalidomide, which all physicians, patients and     pharmacies prescribing, receiving or dispensing thalidomide in     the United States must follow. We also have exclusive rights to     several issued patents covering the use of     THALOMID®     in oncology and other therapeutic areas.        33    Table of Contents   Company     Background                         In 1986, we were spun off from Celanese Corporation and, in July     1987, we completed an initial public offering. Initially, our     operations involved research and development of chemical and     biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical     industries. Between 1990 and 1998, our revenues were derived     primarily from the development and supply of chirally pure     intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug     development. By 1998, sales of chirally pure intermediates     became a less integral part of our strategic focus and, in     January 1998, we sold the chiral intermediates business to     Cambrex Corporation.                    In July 1998, we received our first approval for     THALOMID®     from the FDA which allowed us to market     THALOMID®     for the treatment and suppression of ENL, an inflammatory     complication of leprosy. In May 2006, the FDA approved     THALOMID®     in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly     diagnosed multiple myeloma.                    In April 2000, we entered into a development and license     agreement with Novartis Pharma AG in which we granted to     Novartis an exclusive worldwide license to further develop and     market     FOCALINtm,     our chirally pure version of     RITALIN®.     The agreement provided for significant upfront and milestone     payments to us based on the achievement of various stages in the     regulatory approval process. Under the agreement, we sell     FOCALINtm     to Novartis as well as receive royalties on all of     Novartis sales of FOCALIN     XRtm     and     RITALIN®     family of ADHD-related products.                    In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,     currently known as Signal Pharmaceuticals LLC, d/b/a Celgene     Research San Diego, a biopharmaceutical company focused on     the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes     associated with disease.                    In November 2001, we licensed to Pharmion Corporation exclusive     rights relating to the development and commercial use of our     intellectual property covering thalidomide and     S.T.E.P.S.®     in all countries outside of North America, Japan, China, Taiwan     and Korea (see our references below to the December 2004     amendment with respect to these territories).                    In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., which was a     privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord     blood banking business developing technologies for the recovery     of stem cells from human placental tissues following the     completion of full-term, successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis,     d/b/a Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, now operates as a     wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation, engaged in the     research, recovery, culture-expansion, preservation, development     and distribution of placental stem cells as therapeutic agents.                    In March 2003, we entered into a supply and distribution     agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, to distribute, promote     and sell     ALKERAN®,     or melphalan, a therapy approved by the FDA for the     palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the     ovary. The agreement requires that we purchase     ALKERAN®     from GSK and distribute the products in the United States under     the Celgene label. The agreement has been extended through     March 31, 2009.                    In October 2004, we acquired Penn T Limited, or Penn T, a     supplier of     THALOMID®.     Through manufacturing agreements acquired in the transaction, we     are able to control manufacturing for     THALOMID®.     In the transaction, we also acquired a product supply agreement     to exclusively supply Pharmion with thalidomide, thereby     enabling us to increase our participation in thalidomide sales     in key international markets. Subsequently, in December 2004, we     amended the thalidomide supply agreement with Pharmion and     granted them license rights in additional territories. As     amended, the territory licensed to Pharmion is for all countries     other than the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and China,     excluding Hong Kong.                    In December 2005, the FDA approved     REVLIMID®     for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia     due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes     associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or     without additional cytogenetic abnormalities and, in June 2006,     the FDA approved     REVLIMID®     for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple          34    Table of Contents                  myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy.     In June 2007,     REVLIMID®     was granted full marketing authorization by the EC for use in     combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with     multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy     and in September 2007, approval was granted by Swissmedic and in     January 2008 by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee for use     in this same indication. In November 2007 the EC granted     REVLIMID®     orphan medicinal product designation for treatment of CLL. In     addition, in January 2008,     REVLIMID®     was approved by the Canadian Therapeutic Products Directorate     for treatment of patients with MDS, associated with a deletion     5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional     cytogenetic abnormalities.                           In November 2006, we issued an additional 20,000,000 shares     of our common stock at a public offering price of $51.60 per     share with net proceeds of $1.006 billion.                    In December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility and     certain assets and liabilities from Siegfried located in     Zofingen, Switzerland. The API facility has the capability to     produce multiple drug substances and is being used to produce     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®     API to supply global markets. The facility also may be used to     produce drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates.                    In November 2007, we announced the signing of a definitive     merger agreement pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Pharmion     Corporation. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we will     acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pharmion common stock     for $72.00 per share payable in a combination of cash and shares     of Celgene common stock. The transaction has been unanimously     approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is     subject to customary closing conditions including the approval     of the acquisition by Pharmion stockholders and receipt of     antitrust clearances. The     Hart-Scott-Rodino     Act, or HSR, thirty day waiting period has expired without the     United States Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requesting     additional information with regard to the merger. In addition,     the Bundeskartellamt, Germanys Federal Cartel Office in     charge of reviewing the antitrust aspects of mergers and     acquisitions, has cleared Celgenes pending acquisition of     Pharmion Corporation. On February 5, 2008 the     Form S-4     relating to the merger of Pharmion and Celgene was declared     effective by the SEC. The merger is expected to be completed in     March 2008.

Also contributing to the increase in     sales were price increases and increased sales from our European     Named Patient Program, or NPP, which offers European patients in     need of treatment access to     REVLIMID®     on a compassionate use basis.         Net sales of     THALOMID®     were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to price     increases, partly offset by lower sales volumes as prescriptions     written declined, reflecting the expanded use of     REVLIMID®.         ALKERAN®     net sales were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to     increased prices and a decrease in product returns.     2006 compared to 2005:  In 2006, net sales of     REVLIMID®     were driven primarily by the December 2005 FDA approval for the     treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to     low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated     with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without     additional cytogenetic abnormalities and the June 2006 approval     for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of patients with     multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.     REVLIMID®     net sales recorded in 2005 related to initial stocking at     certain contracted pharmacies following the products     approval on December 27, 2005.         THALOMID®     net sales were higher in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to     the FDAs May 2006 approval for treatment in combination     with dexamethasone of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Price     increases implemented as we shifted towards a cost of therapy     pricing structure as opposed to a price per milligram basis also     contributed to the increase. Partially offsetting the increase     in     THALOMID®     sales were sales volume decreases and higher gross to net sales     adjustments.         ALKERAN®     net sales were slightly higher in 2006, compared to 2005 as     sales benefited from an increase in     ALKERAN®     tablet sales volumes, as well as price increases implemented     during 2006, particularly in     ALKERAN®     IVs (injectables). Largely offsetting the increase in sales were     higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and     distributor chargebacks.         Sales of     FOCALINtm,     which is sold exclusively to Novartis and is dependent on the     timing of orders from Novartis for their commercial     distribution, were higher in 2006, compared to 2005, due to     increased end-market demand.     Gross to Net Sales Accruals:  We record gross     to net sales accruals for sales returns, sales discounts,     Medicaid rebates and distributor charge-backs and service fees.     We base our sales returns allowance, which primarily relates to     THALOMID®,     on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, actual returns     history and other known factors, such as the trend experience     for lots where product is still being returned and inventory     centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by     major pharmacy chains. If the historical data we use to     calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future     returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the     period in which such a determination is made and revenues in     that period could be materially affected. Under this     methodology, we track actual returns by individual production     lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible     for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns     experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible     for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical     return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates     are considered in determining the current sales return     allowance. We do not use information from external sources in     estimating our product returns.     THALOMID®     is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a     result, wholesalers do not stock the product.     REVLIMID®     is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending     itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the     supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity to     date. Sales discounts accruals are based on payment terms     extended to customers. Medicaid rebate accruals are based on     historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid     beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate     amount formula established by the Center for Medicaid and     Medicare Services.        36    Table of Contents       Distributor charge-back accruals are based on the differentials     between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower     government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered     under federally qualified programs. Distributor services     accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the     wholesale distributor for services provided. See Critical     Accounting Policies for further discussion.         Gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related     allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2007,     2006 and 2005 were as follows:                                                                                  Returns                                    Distributor                              and                        Medicaid            Chargebacks                              Allowances           Discounts           Rebates           and Services           Total                 In thousands $                   Balance at December 31, 2004            $       9,600               $       837               $       5,534               $       3,721               $       19,692              Allowances for sales during 2005                19,476                   10,948                   35,009                   35,926                   101,359              Allowances for sales during prior periods                1,780                                      89                                      1,869              Credits issued for prior year sales                (11,380       )               (834       )               (5,623       )               (3,264       )               (21,101       )          Credits issued for sales during 2005                (14,459       )               (9,504       )               (14,049       )               (29,605       )               (67,617       )                                                                                                Balance at December 31, 2005            $       5,017               $       1,447               $       20,960               $       6,778               $       34,202              Allowances for sales during 2006                23,944                   18,847                   22,353                   57,750                   122,894              Allowances for sales during prior periods                30,607                   34                                                         30,641              Credits issued for prior year sales                (35,624       )               (1,481       )               (20,357       )               (6,315       )               (63,777       )          Credits issued for sales during 2006                (14,464       )               (16,551       )               (15,488       )               (47,580       )               (94,083       )                                                                                                Balance at December 31, 2006            $       9,480               $       2,296               $       7,468               $       10,633               $       29,877              Allowances for sales during 2007                22,303                   27,999                   28,420                   72,982                   151,704              Allowances/adjustments for sales during prior periods                17,498                                                         (2,776       )               14,722              Credits issued for prior year sales                (26,979       )               (2,206       )               (7,071       )               (6,725       )               (42,981       )          Credits issued for sales during 2007                (5,568       )               (25,194       )               (19,615       )               (65,275       )               (115,652       )                                                                                                Balance at December 31, 2007            $       16,734               $       2,895               $       9,202               $       8,839               $       37,670                                                                                                   2007 compared to 2006:  Sales return allowances     decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to lower     returns of     ALKERAN®     IV resulting from improved expiration dating on 2006 and 2007     product sales. In addition,     THALOMID®     returns were lower than the prior year primarily due to a 2006     THALOMID®     returns initiative undertaken by one large retail pharmacy     chain. In response to this initiative, we introduced single     sleeves of     THALOMID®     for sale in June of 2006. Previously,     THALOMID®     was sold only in multi-sleeve package configurations. The     additional trade package configuration enabled all retailers to     more efficiently manage their     THALOMID®     inventories resulting in lower 2007 returns. This decrease was     partly offset by current year     THALOMID®     returns, reflecting the impact of a 2007 inventory     centralization and rationalization initiative conducted by     several major pharmacy chains. Under this initiative, inventory     was redistributed amongst individual chain stores in a     S.T.E.P.S.®     compliant manner. This resulted in an increase in     THALOMID®     returns as these major pharmacy chains more effectively managed     their inventory levels at the chain stores.         Discounts increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to     increased sales of     REVLIMID®.         Medicaid rebate allowances increased in 2007 compared to 2006     due to increased sales of     REVLIMID®     as well as price increases for both     THALOMID®     and     REVLIMID®.     Our Medicaid rebate accruals are based on the Medicaid Unit     Rebate Amount formula established by the Center for Medicaid and     Medicare Services using the estimated Medicaid dispense     quantities.     REVLIMID®     dispenses increased resulting from the introduction of the 15mg     and 25mg strength tablets.        37    Table of Contents       Distributor chargebacks increased in 2007 compared to 2006     primarily due to     REVLIMID®,     THALOMID®     and     ALKERAN®     IV price increases, which increased the differential between     annual contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare     providers and our wholesale acquisition cost.     2006 compared to 2005:  Sales returns     allowances increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to     unusually high     THALOMID®     returns from one specific large retail pharmacy chain, which     occurred during the first half of 2006. The returns from this     customer were the results of its efforts to more aggressively     manage inventory, our package configuration which required     pharmacies to purchase full cartons of up to ten sleeves of     THALOMID®     capsules with each order and S.T.E.P.S.     ®related     restrictions, which limited the customers ability to     transfer inventories between its locations. For the past several     years, we have experienced sales returns of approximately 4% of     sales. As a result of the higher returns activity during the     first half of 2006, we recorded additional allowances to     increase our reserve to approximately 9% of all estimated     THALOMID®     pharmacy inventories. In addition, we introduced single sleeve     units, beginning June 7, 2006 (rather than requiring full     carton purchases) and we amended our product returns policy to     include a product returns handling fee. These measures were     designed to allow customers to more effectively manage their     inventories, since they can now order smaller quantities, as     well as limit our product returns exposure. To a lesser extent,     the increase in sales returns allowances also resulted from     higher returns of expired     ALKERAN®     IV product.         Sales discounts increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to     higher net sales. Medicaid rebate allowances decreased in 2006,     compared to 2005, primarily due to the impact of the new     Medicare Part D legislation, which became effective     January 1, 2006. As a result of the new legislation, many     patients who had been eligible to receive     THALOMID®     through Medicaid coverage are now covered under Medicare     Part D. Partially offsetting the     THALOMID®     decrease are Medicaid rebate allowances included in 2006 for     REVLIMID®     sales. Distributor chargebacks increased in 2006, compared to     2005, primarily due to     THALOMID®     price increases, which increased the differential between annual     contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare     providers and our wholesale acquisition cost. Also contributing     to the increase in distributor chargeback allowances was an     increase in     ALKERAN®     IV sales to certain public health services contract eligible     customers and accruals for     REVLIMID®,     which was approved in the U.S. in December 2005.     Other     Revenues:     2007 compared to 2006:  Revenues from     collaborative agreements and other sources totaled     $20.1 million and $18.2 million for 2007 and 2006,     respectively. The $1.9 million increase in 2007 compared to     2006 was primarily due to an increase in license fees generated     from our     S.T.E.P.S.®     program and an increase in umbilical cord blood enrollment,     collection and storage fees generated through our LifeBank USASM     business.         Royalty revenue totaled $85.3 million in 2007, representing     an increase of $16.2 million compared to 2006. The increase     was primarily due to amounts received from Novartis on sales of     their entire family of     Ritalin®     drugs and FOCALIN     XRtm.     2006 compared to 2005:  Revenues from     collaborative agreements and other sources totaled     $18.2 million in 2006, compared to $41.3 million in     2005. The $23.1 million decrease was primarily due to the     inclusion in 2005 of a $20.0 million milestone payment     received from Novartis relating to the FDA marketing approval     for Focalin     XRtm.         Royalty revenue totaled $69.1 million in 2006, representing     an increase of $19.1 million compared to 2005. The increase     was primarily due to amounts received from Novartis on their     sales of FOCALIN     XRtm.        38    Table of Contents   Cost of Goods Sold:  Cost of goods sold and     related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2007,     2006 and 2005 were as follows:                                                          2007           2006           2005                 In thousands $                   Cost of goods sold            $       130,239               $       125,892               $       80,727              Increase from prior year            $       4,347               $       45,165               $       21,001              Percentage increase from prior year                3.5       %               55.9       %               35.2       %          Percentage of net product sales                10.0       %               15.5       %               18.1       %         2007 compared to 2006:  Cost of goods sold     increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to increases in     REVLIMID®     material costs and royalty payments related to both     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®     as sales increased for these two products. The increase was     partly offset by lower     ALKERAN®     material costs related to     ALKERAN®     for injection. As a percentage of net product sales, cost of     goods sold decreased from 18.1% in 2005 and 15.5% in 2006 to     10.0% in 2007 primarily due to the growth of     REVLIMID®,     the products lower cost relative to our other products and     sales price increases.     2006 compared to 2005:  Cost of goods sold was     higher in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher     ALKERAN®     costs.     ALKERAN®     costs tend to experience variability depending on the purchase     price of the specific units sold during a given period. Also     contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold were higher     royalties on     THALOMID®     which resulted from higher net sales and the inclusion of costs     associated with     REVLIMID®     sales.     Research and Development:  Research and     development expenses and related percentages for the years ended     December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:                                                          2007           2006           2005                 In thousands $                   Research and development            $       398,590               $       258,621               $       190,834              Increase from prior year            $       139,969               $       67,787               $       29,982              Percentage increase from prior year                54.1       %               35.5       %               18.6       %          Percentage of total revenue                28.4       %               28.8       %               35.5       %         2007 compared to 2006:  Research and     development expenses increased by $140.0 million in 2007     compared to 2006 primarily due to spending related to clinical     research and development in support of multiple programs,     including     REVLIMID®     and other     IMiDs®     across a broad range of cancers, including NHL and CLL. Expenses     also increased to support ongoing research of other compounds,     such as our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and     placental-derived stem/progenitor cell program. Regulatory     spending increased primarily due to the expansion of     REVLIMID®     in international markets. The expense for 2007 also included a     combined $41.1 million in collaborative research and     development arrangements for early stage compounds with Array     BioPharma Inc. and PTC Therapeutics.         In 2007, research and development expenses consisted of     $137.7 million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical     programs, including $41.1 million for collaborative     research and development arrangements; $203.0 million spent     on other pharmaceutical programs, including toxicology,     analytical research and development, drug discovery, quality and     regulatory affairs; $42.8 million spent on     biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and     $15.1 million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials     programs. These expenditures support ongoing clinical progress     in multiple proprietary development programs for     REVLIMID®     and     THALOMID®,     and for other compounds such as: CC-10004, our lead     anti-inflammatory compound that inhibits PDE-4, which results in     the inhibition of multiple proinflammatory mediators such as     TNF-α and which is currently being evaluated in     Phase II clinical trials in the treatment of psoriasis and     psoriatic arthritis; CC-4047, CC-11006 and CC-11050 which are     currently either being evaluated in Phase I clinical trials or     for which Phase II clinical trials are planned or ongoing;     and our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs as well as the     placental stem cell program.        39    Table of Contents   2006 compared to 2005:  Research and     development expenses increased by $67.8 million in 2006     compared to 2005, primarily due to spending related to clinical     research and development; medical information and education     expenses, which support educating and training the medical     community on hematological cancers such as multiple myeloma and     MDS; and ongoing development of a broad range of compounds and     placental-derived stem cell programs.         In 2006, we spent $95.4 million on human pharmaceutical     clinical programs; $109.1 million on other pharmaceutical     programs, including toxicology, analytical research and     development, drug discovery, quality and regulatory affairs;     $40.8 million on biopharmaceutical discovery and     development programs; and $13.3 million on placental stem     cell and biomaterials programs.         Research and development expense may continue to grow as earlier     stage compounds are moved through the preclinical and clinical     stages. Due to the significant risk factors and uncertainties     inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated     with each of our research and development projects, the cost to     complete such projects can vary. The data obtained from these     tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation     that could delay, limit or prevent a projects advancement     through the various stages of clinical development, which would     significantly impact the costs incurred to bring a project to     completion.

Selling, General and Administrative:  Selling,     general and administrative expenses and related percentages for     the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as     follows:                                                          2007           2006           2005                 In thousands $                   Selling, general and administrative expenses            $       451,870               $       339,669               $       181,796              Increase from prior year            $       112,201               $       157,873               $       67,600              Percentage increase from prior year                33.0       %               86.8       %               59.2       %          Percentage of total revenue                32.1       %               37.8       %               33.9       %         2007 compared to 2006:  Selling, general and     administrative expenses increased by $112.2 million in 2007     compared to 2006, reflecting an increase in sales force costs     related to     REVLIMID®     product launch activities in Europe and an increase in spending     related to our continued expansion throughout Europe, Japan,     Australia and Canada. Donations to non-profit foundations that     assist patients with their co-payments also increased in 2007     compared to 2006.     2006 compared to 2005:  Selling, general and     administrative expenses increased by $157.9 million in 2006     compared to 2005 primarily due to $62.3 million of     share-based compensation expense resulting from the application     of SFAS 123R, which became effective January 1, 2006     and a $63.8 million increase in commercial expenses related     to     REVLIMID®     sales and marketing efforts in the United States. Spending     related to the expansion of our U.S. and international     organization and donations to non-profit foundations that assist     patients with their co-payments also contributed to the expense     increase.     Interest and investment income, net:  Interest     and investment income, net and related percentages for the years     ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:                                                          2007           2006           2005                 In thousands $                   Interest and investment income, net            $       109,813               $       40,352               $       24,557              Increase (decrease) from prior year            $       69,461               $       15,795               $       (3,783       )          Percentage increase (decrease) from prior year                172.1       %               64.3       %               13.3       %             Interest and investment income, net increased by     $69.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher     average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities     balances resulting from the November 2006 issuance of an     additional 20,000,000 shares of our common stock, which     generated net proceeds of $1.006 billion. The year ended     December 31, 2007 included other-than-temporary impairment     losses on marketable securities available for sale of     $5.5 million.        40    Table of Contents       Interest and investment income, net increased by     $15.8 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the favorable     impact of the November 2006 issuance of an additional     20,000,000 shares of our common stock, increase in net     realized gains from the sale of certain marketable securities     and higher short-term interest rates. Included in 2006 and 2005     were other-than-temporary impairment losses on marketable     securities available for sale of $3.8 million and     $3.1 million, respectively.     Equity in losses of affiliated     companies:  Under the equity method of accounting,     we recorded losses of $4.5 million, $8.2 million and     $6.9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The     $3.7 million decrease in losses in 2007 compared to 2006     was primarily due to our investment in EntreMed Inc., which     included a charge of $3.1 million for in-process research     and development related to EntreMeds acquisition of     Miikana Therapeutics Inc. in 2006. The $1.3 million     increase in losses in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to     our share of losses from EntreMed.     Interest expense:  Interest expense was     $11.1 million, $9.4 million and $9.5 million in     2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and primarily reflected     interest and amortization of debt issuance costs related to the     $400 million convertible notes issued on June 3, 2003.     The $1.7 million increase in 2007 was due to the inclusion     of a full years interest on the note payable to Siegfried     resulting from the December 2006 acquisition of the API     manufacturing facility in Switzerland, and was partially offset     by a decrease in interest on the convertible notes resulting     from a substantial amount of conversions to common stock during     the month of December 2007.     Other income (expense), net:  Other income     (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006     and 2005 were as follows:                                                          2007           2006           2005                 In thousands $                   Other income (expense), net            $       (2,350       )           $       5,502               $       (7,509       )          Increase (decrease) in income from prior year            $       (7,852       )           $       13,011               $       (9,163       )             The $7.9 million decrease in other income (expense), net in     2007 compared to 2006 was partly due to a decrease in foreign     exchange gains of $3.8 million.         Other income (expense), net increased by $13.0 million in     2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in foreign     exchange gains of $6.1 million and a $6.5 million     decrease in losses in the estimated value of our investment in     EntreMed warrants.     Income tax provision:  The income tax provision     for 2007 was $290.5 million and reflects tax expense     impacted by certain expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions     outside the United States for which we do not presently receive     a tax benefit and nondeductible expenses which include     share-based compensation expense related to incentive stock     options. The income tax provision for 2006 was     $133.9 million and reflects tax expense impacted by certain     expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions outside the United     States for which we do not presently receive a tax benefit and     nondeductible expenses which include share-based compensation     expense related to incentive stock options.         The income tax provision for 2005 was $20.6 million and     reflects tax expense impacted by certain expenses incurred in     taxing jurisdictions outside the United States for which we do     not presently receive a tax benefit and non-deductible expenses.     This was partially offset by the benefit from the elimination of     valuation allowances totaling $42.6 million as of     March 31, 2005, which was based on the fact that we     determined it was more likely than not that certain benefits of     our deferred tax assets would be realized.        41    Table of Contents   Net income:  Net income and per common share     amounts for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and     2005 were as follows:                                                          2007           2006           2005                 In thousands, except per share amounts                   Net income            $       226,433               $       68,981               $       63,656              Per common share amounts:(1) Basic            $       0.59               $       0.20               $       0.19              Diluted(2)            $       0.54               $       0.18               $       0.18              Weighted average shares:                                                           Basic                383,225                   352,217                   335,512              Diluted                431,858                   407,181                   390,585                           (1)        Amounts have been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split     effected in February 2006.          (2)        In computing diluted earnings per share, the numerator has been     adjusted to add-back the after-tax amount of interest expense     recognized in the year on our convertible debt.      2007 compared to 2006:  Net income increased by     $157.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an     increase in total revenues, primarily from the sales of     REVLIMID®;     increase in interest and investment income resulting from the     issuance of an additional 20,000,000 shares of common stock     in November 2006; decrease in the overall income tax rate from     66% in 2006 to 56% in 2007; partially offset by increased     operating expenses required to support organizational growth,     research and development and the launch of     REVLIMID®     in Europe.     2006 compared to 2005:  Net income increased in     2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in total     revenues partially offset by $53.2 million of after-tax     share-based compensation expense resulting from the application     of SFAS 123R, which became effective January 1, 2006;     inclusion in 2005 of the one-time benefit of $42.6 million     recognized from the elimination of deferred tax asset valuation     allowances; and higher operating expenses in 2006.     Liquidity     and Capital Resources         Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities     for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were     as follows:                                                                                                                      Increase (Decrease)                                                     2007            2006                  2007           2006           2005           Versus 2006           Versus 2005                 In thousands $                   Net cash provided by operating activities            $       477,500               $       83,561               $       41,917               $       393,939               $       41,644              Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities            $       (990,186       )           $       6,784               $       (103,131       )           $       (996,970       )           $       109,915              Net cash provided by financing activities            $       287,695               $       1,221,246               $       52,631               $       (933,551       )           $       1,168,615             Operating Activities:  Net cash provided by     operating activities increased in 2007 compared to 2006,     primarily due to increased earnings, payables, accrued expenses     and taxes payable.     Investing Activities:  Net cash used by     investing activities in 2007 included $893.3 million from     the net purchases of available-for-sale marketable securities,     $64.4 million of capital expenditures and     $23.4 million for purchases of investment securities. Net     cash provided by investing activities in 2006 included     $77.8 million from net sales of available-for-sale     marketable securities, partially offset by $46.1 million of     capital expenditures; $12.4 million for the purchase of an     API manufacturing facility from Siegfried Ltd; $7.4 million     for equity method investments; and $5.1 million for     purchases of investment securities. For 2008, capital     expenditures are estimated to be $120.0 million.        42    Table of Contents   Financing Activities:  Net cash provided by     financing activities in 2007 included $144.7 million of     cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and     the excess tax benefit recognized of $143.0 million.         Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 included     $1.006 billion from our November 2006 public offering,     wherein we issued an additional 20,000,000 shares of our     common stock at a public offering price of $51.60 per share.     Cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in     2006 was $113.1 million and the excess tax benefit     recognized was $102.0 million.     Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and working     capital:  Working capital and cash, cash     equivalents and marketable securities for the years ended     December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:                                                                                  2007                  2007           2006           Increase                 In thousands $                   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities            $       2,738,918               $       1,982,220               $       756,698              Working capital(1)            $       2,835,205               $       1,990,969               $       844,236                           (1)        Includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,     accounts receivable, net of allowances, inventory, and other     current assets, less accounts payable, accrued expenses, income     taxes payable and other current liabilities.      Cash, cash equivalents and marketable     securities:  We invest our excess cash primarily     in money market funds and in U.S. government debt,     U.S. government agency debt, U.S. government-sponsored     agency debt, and corporate debt. All liquid investments with     maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are     classified as cash equivalents and all investments with     maturities of greater than three months from the date of     purchase are classified as marketable securities. We determine     the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable     debt and equity securities at the time of purchase. The increase     in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities from     December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 was primarily     due to net cash provided from operations and proceeds from stock     option exercises.     Accounts receivable, net:  Accounts receivable,     net increased by $39.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due     to increased sales. Days of sales outstanding in 2007 improved     by approximately four days compared to 2006. Accounts     receivable, net increased $49.9 million in 2006 compared to     2005 due to higher net sales, which reflected the launch of     REVLIMID®     in the United States.     Inventory:  Inventory in 2007 increased     $23.7 million compared to 2006 primarily due to an     increases in     REVLIMID®     inventories, resulting from the products introduction in     international markets.     Other current assets:  Other current assets     increased $21.0 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily     due to an increase in prepaid foreign sales and use taxes     and the inclusion of Pharmion deferred merger costs in 2007.     Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current     liabilities:  Accounts payable, accrued expenses     and other current liabilities increased $76.5 million in     2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to increases in accruals for     clinical trial costs and an increase in sales return accruals.     Income taxes payable:  Income taxes payable     increased $131.4 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily     from provisions for income taxes of $290.5 million offset     by a tax benefit on stock option exercises of     $159.3 million.         We expect that combined spending for research and development,     international expansion, commercialization of products and     capital investments will remain at a high level. However, we     anticipate that existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable     securities available for sale, combined with cash received from     expected net product sales and revenues from various research,     collaboration and royalty agreements, will provide sufficient     capital resources to fund our operations for the foreseeable     future.        43    Table of Contents   Contractual     Obligations         The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of     December 31, 2007:                                                                                  Payment Due by Period                 Less than                                    More than                              1 Year           1 to 3 Years           3 to 5 Years           5 Years           Total                 In millions $                   Convertible note obligations            $       196.6               $                      $                      $                      $       196.6              Operating leases                12.1                   22.2                   11.8                   4.5                   50.6              ALKERAN®     supply agreements                30.5                   7.7                                                         38.2              Manufacturing facility note payable                3.6                   7.2                   7.2                   14.1                   32.1              Other contract commitments                21.5                   3.7                                                         25.2                                                                                                    Total            $       264.3               $       40.8               $       19.0               $       18.6               $       342.7                                                                                                   Convertible Debt:  In June 2003, we issued an     aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured     convertible notes. The convertible notes have a five-year term     and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi-annually. The     convertible notes outstanding at December 31, 2007 can be     converted at any time into 16,227,441 shares of common     stock at a stock-split adjusted conversion price of $12.1125 per     share. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the     remaining convertible notes outstanding exceeded their carrying     value of $196.6 million by $514.4 million (for more     information refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the     Consolidated Financial Statements).     Operating leases:  We lease office and research     facilities under various operating lease agreements in the     United States, Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and Singapore.     The non-cancelable lease terms for the operating leases expire     at various dates between 2008 and 2016 and include renewal     options. In general, we are also required to reimburse the     lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance     and other operating costs associated with the leases. For more     information on the major facilities that we occupy under lease     arrangements refer to Part I, Item 2,     Properties.     ALKERAN®     Purchase Commitment:  In March 2003, we entered     into a supply and distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline,     or GSK, to distribute, promote and sell     ALKERAN®     (melphalan), a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative     treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. Under     the terms of the agreement, we purchase     ALKERAN®     tablets and     ALKERAN®     for infusion from GSK and distribute the products in the United     States under the Celgene label. The agreement requires us to     purchase certain minimum quantities each year under a     take-or-pay arrangement. The agreement has been extended through     March 31, 2009. On December 31, 2007, the remaining     minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled     $38.2 million.     Manufacturing Facility Note Payable:  In     December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility and     certain other assets and liabilities from Siegfried located in     Zofingen, Switzerland. The assets were purchased for a     U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately     $46.0 million, consisting of a payment of approximately     $12.4 million at the closing, $3.4 million payable in     each of the first five following years and $3.3 million in     each of the subsequent five years. The transaction included a     technical service agreement which allows us to retain the     necessary support to operate the plant. At December 31,     2007, the remaining commitment based on year-end exchange rates     was a U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately     $32.1 million, which includes imputed interest.     Other Contract Commitments:  In connection with     the acquisition of Penn T on October 21, 2004, we entered     into a five-year minimum period Technical Services Agreement     with Penn Pharmaceutical Services Limited, or PPSL, and Penn     Pharmaceutical Holding Limited under which PPSL provides the     services and facilities necessary for the manufacture of     THALOMID®     and other thalidomide formulations. At December 31, 2007,     the remaining costs to be incurred was approximately     $4.5 million.         We have committed to invest $20.0 million in an investment     fund over a ten-year period, which is callable at any time. On     December 31, 2007, our remaining investment commitment was     $17.0 million. For        44    Table of Contents       more information refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the     Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.         Other contract commitments at December 31, 2007 also     include $3.6 million of various contractual obligations.     Income Taxes Payable:  We have provided a     liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various     federal, state and foreign income tax matters of     $211.3 million, at December 31, 2007. The timing of     the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at     December 31, 2007. The Company does not expect a settlement     within the next twelve months.     New     Accounting Principles         In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or     FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or     SFAS, No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid     Financial Instruments  an amendment of FASB     Statements No. 133 and 140, or SFAS 155, which     permits a fair value re-measurement for any hybrid financial     instrument containing an embedded derivative that would     otherwise require bifurcation. We have adopted the provisions of     SFAS 155 effective January 1, 2007 and have determined     that it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.         In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,     or FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income     Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement     No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for     uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises     financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,     Accounting for Income Taxes, and prescribes a     recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the     financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax     position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.     FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,     classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim     periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted the provisions of     FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 had no     cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption. Refer to     Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for     additional information.         On May 2, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position     FIN 48-1,     or FSP     FIN 48-1,     Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation     No. 48. FSP     FIN 48-1     provides guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether     a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of     recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. We     retroactively adopted the provisions of FSP     FIN 48-1     effective January 1, 2007 and have determined that it had     no impact on our consolidated financial statements.         In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,     Fair Value Measurements, which establishes a     framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures     about fair value measurements. The FASB partially deferred the     effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and     liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in     the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis while the     effective date for nonfinancial and financial assets and     liabilities that are recognized on a recurring basis is     effective beginning January 1, 2008. We have determined     that the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material     impact on our consolidated financial statements.         In December 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF Issue     No. 00-19-2,     Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements, or     FSP 00-19-2,     which addresses an issuers accounting for registration     payment arrangements.     FSP 00-19-2     specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments     or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment     arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included     as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement,     should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with     SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.     FSP 00-19-2     was issued in December 2006 and was effective immediately for     registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments     subject to those arrangements that were entered into or modified     subsequent to the issuance of     FSP 00-19-2.     For registration payment arrangements and financial instruments     subject to those arrangements entered into prior to the issuance     of     FSP 00-19-2,     it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years     beginning after December 15, 2006. We have adopted the     provisions of     FSP 00-19-2     effective        45    Table of Contents       January 1, 2007 and have determined that the adoption had     no impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to     Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for     additional information.         In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,     The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities, or SFAS 159, which provides companies     with an option to report selected financial assets and     liabilities at fair value. SFAS 159 establishes     presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate     comparisons between companies that choose different measurement     attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and     highlights the effect of a companys choice to use fair     value on its earnings. It also requires a company to display the     fair value of those assets and liabilities for which it has     chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet.     SFAS 159 will be effective for us beginning January 1,     2008 and is not expected to have a material impact on our     consolidated financial statements.         In June 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force, or     EITF, Issue     No. 07-3,     Accounting for Non-Refundable Advance Payments for Goods     or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development     Activities, or     EITF 07-3,     which provides that non-refundable advance payments for future     research and development activities should be deferred and     capitalized until the related goods are delivered or the related     services are performed.     EITF 07-3     will be effective for us on a prospective basis beginning     January 1, 2008.         In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue     No. 07-1,     Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the     Development and Commercialization of Intellectual     Property, or     EITF 07-1,     which provides guidance on how the parties to a collaborative     agreement should account for costs incurred and revenue     generated on sales to third parties, how sharing payments     pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the     income statement and certain related disclosure requirements.     EITF 07-1     will be effective for us beginning January 2009 on a     retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of     the adoption of     EITF 07-1     will have, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.     Critical     Accounting Policies         A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to     the portrayal of our financial condition and results of     operation and requires managements most difficult,     subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need     to make estimates about the effect of matters that are     inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies     are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the     Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual     Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be     critical:     Revenue Recognition on Collaboration     Agreements:  We have formed collaborative research     and development agreements and alliances with several     pharmaceutical companies. These agreements are in the form of     research and development and license agreements. The agreements     call for nonrefundable upfront payments, milestone payments on     achieving significant milestone events, and in some cases     ongoing research funding. The agreements also contemplate     royalty payments on sales if and when the compounds receive     regulatory marketing approval.         Our revenue recognition policies for all nonrefundable upfront     license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with     the guidance provided in the Securities and Exchange     Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,     No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial     Statements, as amended by SAB No. 104,     Revenue Recognition, or SAB 104. In addition,     we follow the provisions of EITF Issue     No. 00-21,     Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, or     EITF 00-21,     for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or     materially amended after June 30, 2003.     EITF 00-21     provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that     involves multiple revenue-generating activities or deliverables     should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue     recognition purposes, and if this division is required, how the     arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate     units of accounting. If the deliverables in a revenue     arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to     the EITFs separation criteria, the revenue recognition     policy must be determined for each identified unit. If the     arrangement is a single unit of accounting, the revenue     recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement.         Under arrangements where the license fees and research and     development activities can be accounted for as a separate unit     of accounting, nonrefundable upfront license fees are deferred     and recognized as revenue on        46    Table of Contents       a straight-line basis over the expected term of our continued     involvement in the research and development process. Revenues     from the achievement of research and development milestones, if     deemed substantive, are recognized as revenue when the     milestones are achieved, and the milestone payments are due and     collectible. Milestones are considered substantive if all of the     following conditions are met: (1) the milestone is     nonrefundable; (2) achievement of the milestone was not     reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement;     (3) substantive effort is involved to achieve the     milestone; and (4) the amount of the milestone appears     reasonable in relation to the effort expended, the other     milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated     with achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions     are not met, we would recognize a proportionate amount of the     milestone payment upon receipt as revenue that correlates to     work already performed and the remaining portion of the     milestone payment will be deferred and recognized as revenue as     we complete our performance obligations.     Gross to Net Sales Accruals for Sales Returns, Medicaid     Rebates and Chargebacks:  Our gross to net sales     accruals for Sales Returns, Medicaid Rebates and Chargebacks are     based on our sales     and/or     estimates of third-party inventories. Our accrual methodologies     are described in more detail below.         THALOMID®     is distributed under our     S.T.E.P.S.®     distribution program. Among other things,     S.T.E.P.S.®,     which is a proprietary comprehensive education and     risk-management distribution program, requires prescribers,     patients and dispensing pharmacies to participate in a registry     and prohibits the filling of a     THALOMID®     order unless the physician, patient and pharmacy have all     obtained an appropriate authorization number. Automatic refills     are not permitted under the program. Each prescription may not     exceed a     28-day     supply and a new prescription is required with each order.     Although we invoice through traditional pharmaceutical     wholesalers, all     THALOMID®     orders are drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy     overnight. Wholesaler stocking of this product is prohibited. In     addition, we do not offer commercial discounts on our products     to pharmacies or hospitals and, therefore, have no commercial     distributor chargebacks.         REVLIMID®     is distributed under the     RevAssist®     program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution     program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of     REVLIMID®,     and is sold primarily through contracted pharmacies lending     itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the     supply channel. The     RevAssist®     program includes most of the same attributes of the     S.T.E.P.S.®     program mentioned above.         ALKERAN®     is distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical     industry supply chain.     ALKERAN®     is not subjected to     S.T.E.P.S.®     or     RevAssist®     distribution restrictions. It may be stocked by multiple     wholesalers and prescribed by physicians without our     preauthorization.     Sales Returns:  We base our sales returns     allowance, which primarily relates to     THALOMID®,     on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, actual returns     history and other known factors, such as the trend experience     for lots where product is still being returned and inventory     centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by     major pharmacy chains. If the historical data we use to     calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future     returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the     period in which such a determination is made and revenues in     that period could be materially affected. Under this     methodology, we track actual returns by individual production     lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible     for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns     experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible     for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical     return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates     are considered in determining the current sales return     allowance. We do not use information from external sources in     estimating our product returns. As indicated above,     THALOMID®     is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a     result, wholesalers do not stock the product.     REVLIMID®     is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending     itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the     supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity to     date.         External factors such as price changes from competitors and     introductions of new and generic competing products could have     an impact on our sales returns. Our sales returns have not been     impacted thus far by such external factors; however, we continue     to monitor such factors. Our sales returns allowances were     $39.8 million, $54.6 million and $21.3 million in     2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which equates to an accrual     rate of        47    Table of Contents       2.7%, 5.7% and 3.9% of gross product sales in each of the three     respective years. A 10% increase in our 2007 returns rate would     have resulted in a $4.0 million decrease in our 2007     reported revenue.     Medicaid Rebates:  Our Medicaid rebate accruals     are computed using the Medicaid rebate formula established by     the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This formula     establishes a quarterly Unit Rebate Amount (URA) for eligible     drugs based on our quarterly average manufacturers price (AMP).     We apply the calculated AMP to estimated quarterly Medicaid     dispense quantities for our products. Actual Medicaid dispense     quantities are reported by individual states on a     45-60 day     quarter-end lag. Differences in Medicaid rebate accruals     resulting from differences in the estimated Medicaid dispense     quantities and actual Medicaid dispense quantities are adjusted     in the following period. The URA calculation allows for     manufacturer price increases based on increases in the Consumer     Price Index-All Urban Consumers. Price increases in excess of     the allowable Medicaid increase result in a higher unit rebate     amount. Our Medicaid rebate allowances increased in 2007     compared to 2006 due primarily to increased sales of     REVLIMID®     as well as price increases for both     THALOMID®     and     REVLIMID®     above the allowable Medicaid increase.     Distributor Chargebacks:  As indicated above,     we do not offer commercial discounts on our products to     pharmacies or hospitals and, therefore, have no commercial     distributor chargebacks. Our distributor chargebacks result from     the difference between prices paid by the wholesaler to acquire     our products and the lower prices the wholesaler is legally     obligated to extend to federally funded healthcare providers     such as Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense entities as     well as non-federal PHS/340B entities. We estimate distributor     chargeback allowances at the time of sale based on the     pharmacies to which the order was drop-shipped and its     eligibility for the lower pricing. Actual chargeback credits     claimed by the wholesaler may significantly differ from our     accruals.     THALOMID®     chargeback allowances are more sensitive to current price     changes due to the cumulative increase to the     THALOMID®     wholesale acquisition price since its initial commercial launch     date.     REVLIMID®     chargeback allowances are less sensitive to current wholesale     acquisition cost price increases due to its relatively recent     commercial launch date.     Other Gross to Net Sales Accruals:  We record     sales discounts accruals based on payment terms extended to     customers and we record distributor services accruals based on     contractual fees incurred for the wholesale distributor services     provided.     Income Taxes:  We utilize the asset and     liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this     method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based     on the difference between the financial statement carrying     amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted     tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences     are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when     it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be     realized.         Our 2007 effective tax rate is approximately 56.2%. The     effective tax rate exceeds the statutory tax rate primarily due     to certain expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions outside the     United States for which we do not presently receive a tax     benefit and nondeductible expenses which include share-based     compensation expense related to incentive stock options. We     operate under an incentive tax holiday in Switzerland that     expires in 2015 and exempts us from certain Swiss taxes.     Likewise, expenses currently being incurred in Switzerland do     not provide a tax benefit. To the extent we receive approvals in     markets outside the United States, and manufacture and generate     taxable income subject to our Swiss tax holiday, we would expect     our effective tax rate to be lower in the future.         We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 and FSP     FIN 48-1     effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the     accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an     enterprises financial statements in accordance with     SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,     and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute     for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax     position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.     FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,     classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim     periods, disclosure and transition. We had no cumulative effect     adjustment related to the adoption. We account for interest and     penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our     provision for income taxes. These unrecognized tax benefits     relate primarily to issues common among multinational     corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of     methodologies in making these estimates which include studies     performed by independent economists, advice from industry and     subject experts, evaluation of public        48    Table of Contents       actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing     authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide     estimates for unrecognized tax benefits. If our estimates are     not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be     materially impacted.         At March 31, 2005, we determined it was more likely than     not that we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize     the benefits of our deferred tax assets and, as a result,     eliminated certain deferred tax valuation allowances, which     resulted in us recording an income tax benefit in 2005 of     $42.6 million and an increase to additional paid-in capital     of $30.2 million. The decision to eliminate the deferred     tax valuation allowances was based on an external Independent     Data Monitoring Committees, or IDMC, analysis of two     Phase III Special Protocol Assessment multiple myeloma     trials and the conclusion that these trials exceeded the     pre-specified stopping rule. The IDMC found a statistically     significant improvement in time to disease     progression  the primary endpoint of these     Phase III trials  in patients receiving     REVLIMID®     plus dexamethasone compared to patients receiving dexamethasone     alone. This, in concert with our nine consecutive quarters of     profitability, led to the conclusion that it was more likely     than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income to     realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets.         We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of     deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these     deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we     believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors     when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred     tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience     by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income,     carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes,     various income tax strategies and other relevant factors.     Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and,     to the extent future expectations change, we would have to     assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that     time. At December 31, 2007, it was more likely than not     that we would realize our deferred tax assets, net of valuation     allowances.     Share-Based Compensation:  We adopted the     provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or     SFAS, No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, or     SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006, which requires     that all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the     financial statements at their fair values. We adopted     SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method     under which the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new awards     and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the     adoption date. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to     estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which     requires certain estimates to be made by management including     the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options.     Management also makes decisions regarding the method of     calculating the expected volatilities and the risk-free interest     rate used in the model. Fluctuations in the market that affect     these estimates could have an impact on the resulting     compensation cost. Additionally, compensation cost for the     portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been     rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is     recognized over the remaining service period after the adoption     date (for additional information refer to Note 13 of the     Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this     Annual Report).     Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Available-For-Sale     Marketable Securities: A decline in the market value of any     available-for-sale marketable security below its cost that is     deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in     carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to     operations and a new cost basis for the security established.     The determination of whether an available-for-sale marketable     security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires significant     judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative     and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment.     Factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is     other-than-temporarily impaired include: significant     deterioration in the issuers earnings performance, credit     rating, asset quality, business prospects of the issuer, adverse     changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer     operates, length of time that the fair value has been below our     cost, our expected future cash flows from the security and our     intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient     period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the     investment. Assumptions associated with these factors are     subject to future market and economic conditions, which could     differ from our assessment. During 2007 and 2006, we determined     that certain securities had sustained other-than-temporary     impairments and, as a result, we recognized impairment losses of     $5.5 million and $3.8 million in 2007 and 2006,     respectively, which were recorded in interest and investment     income, net.        49    Table of Contents   Investment in Affiliated Companies:  Our     investment in affiliated companies includes an investment in     EntreMed which had a carrying value of $12.2 million and a     fair value of $12.4 million at December 31, 2007. If     the carrying value of our investment were to exceed its fair     value, we would review it to determine if an     other-than-temporary decline in value of the investment has been     sustained. If the investment is determined to have sustained an     other-than-temporary decline in value, the investment will be     written-down to its fair value. Such an evaluation is judgmental     and dependent on the specific facts and circumstances. Factors     that we consider in determining whether an other-than-temporary     decline in value has occurred include: the market value of the     security in relation to its cost basis, the period of time that     the market value is below cost, the financial condition of the     investee and our intent and ability to retain the investment for     a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market     value of the investment. We evaluate information that we are     aware of in addition to quoted market prices, if any, in     determining if an other-than-temporary decline in value exists.     Accounting for Long-Term Incentive Plans:  We     have established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed     to provide key officers and executives with performance-based     incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of     pre-established corporate performance objectives covering a     three-year period. We currently have three three-year     performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31,     2008, 2009 and 2010. The 2008 performance cycle was approved by     the Management Compensation and Development Committee of the     Board of Directors in February 2008 and began on January 1,     2008 with an ending date of December 31, 2010. Performance     measures for each LTIP are based on the following components in     the last year of the three-year cycle: 25% on earnings per     share, 25% on net income and 50% on revenue.         Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the     participants salary for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 plans. The     estimated payout for the concluded 2007 cycle is     $6.2 million and the maximum potential payout, assuming     objectives are achieved at the maximum level for the 2008, 2009     and 2010 cycles, are $6.4 million, $8.0 million and     $10.0 million, respectively. Such awards are payable in     cash or, at our discretion, in our common stock based upon our     stock price at the payout date. We accrue the long-term     incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior to the end     of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of     our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in     control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment     equal to their target award, or, if higher, an award based on     actual performance through the date of the change in control.     For 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized expense related to the     LTIP of $6.9 million, $4.6 million and     $4.4 million, respectively.         Accruals recorded for the LTIP entail making certain assumptions     concerning future earnings per share, net income and revenues,     the actual results of which could be materially different than     the assumptions used. Accruals for the LTIP are reviewed on a     regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability     recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts. In     estimating the accruals, management considers actual results to     date for the performance period, expected results for the     remainder of the performance period, operating trends, product     development, pricing and competition.           ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE     AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK           The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative     and qualitative information about our potential exposure to     market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising     from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The     risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse     changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.         We have established guidelines relative to the diversification     and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity.     These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified     depending on market conditions. Although investments may be     subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit     quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of     credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of     investment. At December 31, 2007, our market risk sensitive     instruments consisted of derivatives, marketable securities     available for sale, unsecured convertible notes issued by us and     our notes payable to Siegfried.     Derivatives:  We periodically utilize forward     contracts to economically hedge non-functional currency     exposures. At December 31, 2007, we had foreign currency     forward contracts outstanding to hedge non-        50    Table of Contents       functional currency assets denominated in Swiss Francs, British     Pounds, Japanese Yen and U.S. dollars. The aggregate     notional amount of these contracts was $43.1 million and     they expire within one year. The contracts are hedges of     receivables at U.K. and Swiss foreign entities and are     remeasured through earnings each period along with the     underlying hedged item. At December 31, 2007, the net     unrealized gain on the forward contracts was approximately     $0.1 million in the aggregate.         Although not predictive in nature, we believe a hypothetical 10%     threshold reflects a reasonably possible near-term change in     foreign currency rates. Assuming that the year-end exchange     rates were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10% decrease in     the underlying currencies, the fair value of the contracts would     decrease by approximately $7.6 million. However, since the     contracts hedge assets denominated in currencies other than the     entitys functional currency, any change in the fair value     of the contract would be offset by a change in the underlying     value of the hedged items.     Marketable Securities Available for Sale:  At     December 31, 2007, our marketable securities available for     sale consisted of U.S. Treasury securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,     mortgage-backed obligations, corporate debt securities and     1,939,598 shares of Pharmion Corporation common stock.     Marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair     value, held for an unspecified period of time and intended for     use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and     losses on available-for-sale securities, which are deemed to be     temporary, are reported as a separate component of     stockholders equity, net of tax. The cost of debt     securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and     accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with     realized gains and losses, is included in interest and     investment income, net.         As of December 31, 2007, the principal amounts, fair values     and related weighted average interest rates of our investments     in debt securities classified as marketable securities     available-for-sale were as follows:                                                                                  Duration                 Less than                                    More than                              1 Year           1 to 3 Years           3 to 5 Years           5 Years           Total                 In thousands $                   Principal amount            $       624,243               $       694,011               $       55,988               $       10,000               $       1,384,242              Fair value            $       625,830               $       705,326               $       56,943               $       10,623               $       1,398,722              Average interest rate                4.6       %               4.5       %               4.7       %               4.5       %               4.6       %         Pharmion Common Stock:  At December 31,     2007, we held a total of 1,939,598 shares of Pharmion     Corporation common stock, which had an estimated fair value of     approximately $121.9 million (based on the closing price     reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers     Automated Quotations, or NASDAQ), and, which exceeded the cost     by approximately $101.7 million. The amount by which the     fair value exceeded the cost (i.e., the unrealized gain) was     included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the     stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance     Sheet. The fair value of the Pharmion common stock investment is     subject to market price volatility and any increase or decrease     in Pharmions common stock quoted market price will have a     similar percentage increase or decrease in the fair value of our     investment (Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the     Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the     proposed merger with Pharmion).     Convertible Debt:  In June 2003, we issued an     aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured     convertible notes. The convertible notes have a five-year term     and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi-annually. The     convertible notes outstanding at December 31, 2007 can be     converted at any time into 16,227,441 shares of common     stock at a stock-split adjusted conversion price of $12.1125 per     share (for more information refer to Note 9 of the Notes to     the Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 31,     2007, the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the     carrying value of $196.6 million by approximately     $514.4 million, which we believe reflects the increase in     the market price of our common stock to $46.21 per share as of     December 31, 2007. Assuming other factors are held     constant, an increase in interest rates generally results in a     decrease in the fair value of fixed-rate convertible debt, but     does not impact the carrying value, and an increase in our stock     price generally results in an increase in the fair value of     convertible debt, but does not impact the carrying value.        51    Table of Contents   Note Payable:  At December 31, 2007, the     fair value of our note payable to Siegfried approximated the     carrying value of the note of $26.2 million. Assuming other     factors are held constant, an increase in interest rates     generally will result in a decrease in the fair value of the     note. The fair value of the note will also be affected by     changes in the U.S. dollar / Swiss franc exchange     rate. The note is denominated in Swiss francs.           ITEM 8.

CONTROLS     AND PROCEDURES     CONCLUSION     REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND     PROCEDURES         As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we     carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the     participation of our management, including our Chief Executive     Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the     design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures     (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934     Rules 13a-15(e)     and     15d-15(e)).     Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have     concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are     effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by     us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act     is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time     periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and     Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and     communicated to our management (including our Chief Executive     Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions     regarding required disclosures. Based on such evaluation, our     Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have     concluded that we are in compliance with     Rule 13a-15(e)     of the Exchange Act.        52    Table of Contents   MANAGEMENTS     REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING         Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining     adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the     assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over     financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange     Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed by, or under the supervision of our principal     executive and principal financial officers and effected by our     Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide     reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial     reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial     statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted     accounting principles.         Our internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;     (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are     recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated     financial statements in accordance with generally accepted     accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures     are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our     management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable     assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that     could have a material effect on the consolidated financial     statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         In connection with the preparation of our annual consolidated     financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of     the effectiveness of our internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the     Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework. Managements     assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal     control over financial reporting and testing of the operational     effectiveness of those controls.         Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our     internal control over financial reporting was effective as of     December 31, 2007.         KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that     audited our consolidated financial statements included in this     report, has issued their report on the effectiveness of internal     control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, a     copy of which is included herein.        53    Table of Contents   REPORT OF     INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         The Board of Directors and Stockholders       Celgene Corporation:         We have audited Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries     internal control over financial reporting as of     December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in     Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the     Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway     Commission, or COSO. Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries     management is responsible for maintaining effective internal     control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the     effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,     included in the accompanying Managements Report On     Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is     to express an opinion on the effectiveness of Celgene     Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over     financial reporting based on our audit.         We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control     over financial reporting was maintained in all material     respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of     internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk     that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the     design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on     the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other     procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We     believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our     opinion.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions     are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial     statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting     principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company     are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (3) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         In our opinion, Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries maintained,     in all material respects, effective internal control over     financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on     criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by COSO.         We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the     consolidated balance sheets of Celgene Corporation and     subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the     related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and     stockholders equity for each of the years in the     three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our report     dated February 19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on     those consolidated financial statements.         /s/ KPMG LLP       Short Hills, New Jersey       February 19, 2008        54    Table of Contents   CHANGES     IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING         There have not been any changes in our internal control over     financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended     December 31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are     reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control     over financial reporting.

In connection with our audits of the     consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the     consolidated financial statement schedule,     Schedule II  Valuation and Qualifying     Accounts. These consolidated financial statements and     consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility     of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to     express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements     and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our     audits.         We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are     free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a     test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in     the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, as well as evaluating the overall financial     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a     reasonable basis for our opinion.         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred     to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial     position of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries as of     December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their     operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the     three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity     with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,     in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement     schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated     financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all     material respects, the information set forth therein.

Statements   December 31, 2007   (Thousands of dollars, except per share amounts, unless     otherwise indicated)           (1)     Nature of     Business and Summary of Significant Accounting     Policies       Nature of Business and Basis of     Presentation:  Celgene Corporation and its     subsidiaries (collectively Celgene or the     Company) is a global biopharmaceutical company     primarily engaged in the discovery, development and     commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat     cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. The Companys     commercial stage products include     REVLIMID®,     THALOMID®,     ALKERAN®     and     FOCALINtm.     FOCALINtm     is sold exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis. The     Company also derives revenues from a licensing agreement with     Novartis which entitles it to royalties on FOCALIN     XRtm     and the entire     RITALIN®     family of drugs; a licensing and product supply agreement with     Pharmion Corp. for its sales of thalidomide; and sales of     bio-therapeutic products and services through its Cellular     Therapeutics subsidiary.         The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of     Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries. All inter-company     transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in     limited partnerships and interests where we have an equity     interest of 50% or less and do not otherwise have a controlling     financial interest are accounted for by either the equity or     cost method. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified     to conform to the current years presentation.         The preparation of the consolidated financial statements     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that     affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could     differ from those estimates. The Company is subject to certain     risks and uncertainties related to product development,     regulatory approval, market acceptance, scope of patent and     proprietary rights, intense competition, rapid technological     change and product liability.     Financial Instruments:  Certain financial     instruments reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, (e.g.,     cash, cash equivalents, account receivable, certain other     assets, accounts payable and certain other liabilities) are     recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their     short-term nature. The fair values of financial instruments     other than marketable securities are determined through a     combination of management estimates and information obtained     from third parties using the latest market data. The fair value     of available-for-sale marketable securities is based on quoted     market prices. The carrying value of the note payable to     Siegfried was $26.2 million at December 31, 2007 and     approximated its fair value. The fair values of the following     financial instruments are disclosed in the following footnotes:     marketable securities (Note 4); EntreMed, Inc. common stock     (Note 7); and convertible debt (Note 9).     Derivative Instruments:  The Company     periodically utilizes forward contracts to economically hedge     non-functional currency exposures. At December 31, 2007,     the Company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding     to hedge non-functional currency assets denominated in Swiss     Francs, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and U.S. dollars. The     aggregate notional amount of these contracts was     $43.1 million and they expire within one year. The     contracts are hedges of receivables at U.K. and Swiss foreign     entities and are remeasured through operations each period. At     December 31, 2007, the net unrealized gain on the forward     contracts was approximately $0.1 million in the aggregate.     Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available     for Sale:  We invest our excess cash in money     market funds and in highly liquid debt instruments, including     U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government-sponsored     agency securities, mortgage-backed obligations, corporate debt     securities, and 1,939,598 shares of Pharmion common stock.     Investments with maturities of three months or less from the     date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and     investments with maturities of greater than three months from     date of purchase are classified as marketable securities     available for sale. Marketable securities available for sale are     carried at fair value, held for an indefinite period of time and     intended for use in meeting the Companys ongoing liquidity     needs. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale     securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a     separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax. The     cost of debt securities        F-7    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of     discounts to maturity. The amortization and accretion, along     with realized gains and losses, is included in interest and     investment income, net.         A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security     below its carrying value that is determined to be     other-than-temporary would result in a charge to earnings and     decrease in the securitys carrying value to its newly     established fair value. Factors evaluated to determine if an     investment is other-than-temporarily impaired include     significant deterioration in earnings performance, credit     rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the issuer;     adverse changes in the general market condition in which the     issuer operates; the intent and ability to retain the investment     for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the     market value of the investment; and, issues that raise concerns     about the issuers ability to continue as a going concern.     Concentration of Credit Risk:  Cash, cash     equivalents, and marketable securities are financial instruments     that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit     risk. The Company invests its excess cash primarily in     U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government-sponsored     agency securities, mortgage-backed obligations and corporate     debt securities with high credit ratings. The Company may also     invest in unrated or below investment grade securities, such as     equity in private companies. The Company has established     guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to     maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed     periodically and may be modified to react to changes in market     risk and take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates.         The Company sells     THALOMID® and     ALKERAN® primarily through wholesale distributors and     REVLIMID® primarily to specialty pharmacies; therefore, wholesale     distributors account for a large portion of the Companys     trade receivables and net product revenues (refer to     Note 18). In light of this concentration, the Company     continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and     has internal policies regarding customer credit limits. The     Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on     the credit worthiness of its customers, aging of receivable     balances and general economic conditions.     Inventory:  Inventories are recorded at the     lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a     first-in,     first-out basis. The Company periodically reviews the     composition of inventory in order to identify obsolete,     slow-moving or otherwise unsaleable items. If unsaleable items     are observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory,     the Company will record a write-down to net realizable value in     the period that the decline in value is first recognized.     Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production     of preclinical and clinical products, which are charged to     research and development expense when consumed.     Property, Plant and Equipment:  Property, plant     and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.     Depreciation of plant and equipment is recorded using the     straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated     over the lesser of the economic useful life of the asset or the     remaining term of the lease, including anticipated renewal     options. The estimated useful lives of plant and equipment are     as follows:                         Buildings            40 years          Building and operating equipment            15 years          Manufacturing machinery and equipment            10 years          Machinery and equipment            5 years          Furniture and fixtures            5 years          Computer equipment and software            3-5 years             Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred,     while expenditures for improvements which extend the life of an     asset are capitalized.     Investment in Affiliated Companies:  At     December 31, 2007, the Company held 10,364,864 shares     of EntreMed, Inc. common stock, representing an ownership     interest of approximately 12.2% in EntreMed. The Company also     holds 3,350,000 shares of EntreMed voting preferred shares     that are convertible into        F-8    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         16,750,000 shares of common stock and therefore, the     Company determined that it has the ability to exercise     significant influence over EntreMed and therefore, applies the     equity method of accounting to its common stock investment. The     Company also applies the equity method of accounting for its     investment in an investment fund which invests in     start-up     companies conducting business in life sciences such as     biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical technology, devices,     diagnostics and health and wellness.         Equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible     impairment. If an investments fair value is determined to     be less than its net carrying value and the decline is     determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written     down to its newly established fair value. Such an evaluation is     judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances.     Factors considered in determining whether an     other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include:     market value of the investment based on either market-quoted     prices or future rounds of financing by the investee; length of     time that the market value was below its cost basis; financial     condition and business prospects of the investee; the     Companys intent and ability to retain the investment for a     sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value     of the investment; any other information that the Company may be     aware of related to the investment.     Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:  Goodwill     represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net     assets acquired in an acquisition accounted for by the purchase     method of accounting and is not amortized, but subject to     impairment testing at least annually. Intangible assets with     definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual     values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for     impairment if certain events occur as described below.         The Companys intangible assets consist of supply     agreements, contract-based licenses, technology and an acquired     workforce. Remaining amortization periods related to these     categories range from 4 to 13 years.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:  Long-lived     assets, such as property, plant and equipment, software costs     and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed     for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances     indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be     recoverable.         Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a     comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to     the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be     generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of the assets     exceed their estimated future undiscounted net cash flows, an     impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the     carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the     assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented     in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of     their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell, and are     no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal     group classified as held for sale would be presented separately     in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the     consolidated balance sheet.     Foreign Currency Translation:  Operations in     non-U.S. entities     are recorded in the functional currency of each entity. For     financial reporting purposes, the functional currency of an     entity is determined by a review of the source of an     entitys most predominant cash flows. The results of     operations for     non-U.S. entities     are translated from functional currencies into U.S. dollars     using the average currency rate during each period, which     approximates the results that would be obtained using actual     currency rates on the dates of individual transactions. Assets     and liabilities are translated using currency rates at the end     of the period. Adjustments resulting from translating the     financial statements of the Companys foreign entities into     the U.S. dollar are excluded from the determination of net     income and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive     income. Transaction gains and losses are recorded as incurred in     other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of     Operations.     Research and Development Costs:  Research and     development costs are expensed as incurred. These include all     internal costs, external costs related to services contracted by     the Company and research services conducted for others. Upfront     and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with     research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred     up to the point of regulatory approval. Milestone        F-9    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval     are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of     the related product.     Income Taxes:  The Company utilizes the asset     and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this     method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based     on the difference between the financial statement carrying     amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted     tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences     are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when     it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a     deferred tax asset will not be realized. Research and     development tax credits are recognized as a reduction of the     provision for income taxes when realized. The Company recognizes     the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or     expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax     position is more likely than not to be sustained. Prior to 2007,     the Company recognized the benefit of certain tax positions it     had taken or expected to take on income tax returns it filed if     such positions were probable of being sustained.     Revenue Recognition:  Revenue from the sale of     products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the     product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for     discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and     distributor charge-backs under terms customary in the industry     are provided for in the same period the related sales are     recorded. Provisions recorded in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled     approximately $166.4 million, $153.5 million and     $103.2 million, respectively.         We base our sales returns allowance, which primarily relates to     THALOMID®,     on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, actual returns     history and other known factors, such as the trend experience     for lots where product is still being returned and inventory     centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by     major pharmacy chains. If the historical data we use to     calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future     returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the     period in which such a determination is made and revenues in     that period could be materially affected. Under this     methodology, we track actual returns by individual production     lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible     for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns     experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible     for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical     return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates     are considered in determining the current sales return     allowance. We do not use information from external sources in     estimating our product returns.     THALOMID®     is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a     result, wholesalers do not stock the product.     REVLIMID®     is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending     itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the     supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity to     date.         Revenue under research contracts is recorded as earned under the     contracts, as services are provided. In accordance with SEC     Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104,     Revenue Recognition, upfront nonrefundable fees     associated with license and development agreements where the     Company has continuing involvement in the agreement, are     recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated     service period of the last item of performance to be delivered.     If the estimated service period is subsequently modified, the     period over which the up-front fee is recognized is modified     accordingly on a prospective basis.         SAB No. 104 requires companies to identify separate     units of accounting based on the consensus reached in Emerging     Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue     No. 00-21,     Revenue Arrangements With Multiple Deliverables, or     EITF 00-21. EITF 00-21     provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that     involves multiple revenue-generating activities or deliverables     should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue     recognition purposes, and if this division is required, how the     arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate     units of accounting. If the deliverables in a revenue     arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to     the EITFs separation criteria, the revenue-recognition     policy must be determined for each identified unit. If the     arrangement is a single unit of accounting, the     revenue-recognition policy must be determined for the entire     arrangement. Under arrangements where the license fees and     research and development activities can be accounted for as a     separate unit of accounting,        F-10    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         nonrefundable upfront license fees are deferred and recognized     as revenue on a straight-line basis over the expected term of     the Companys continued involvement in the research and     development process. Revenues from the achievement of research     and development milestones, if deemed substantive, are     recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved, and the     milestone payments are due and collectible. Milestones are     considered substantive if all of the following conditions are     met: (1) the milestone is nonrefundable;     (2) achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured     at the inception of the arrangement; (3) substantive effort     is involved to achieve the milestone; and, (4) the amount     of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort     expended, the other milestones in the arrangement and the     related risk associated with achievement of the milestone. If     any of these conditions are not met, the Company would recognize     a proportionate amount of the milestone payment upon receipt as     revenue that correlates to work already performed and the     remaining portion of the milestone payment would be deferred and     recognized as revenue as the Company completes its performance     obligations.     Share-Based Compensation:  In December 2004,     the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS,     No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, or     SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R, which revised     SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock-Based     Compensation, or, SFAS 123, and superseded Accounting     Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25, Accounting     for Stock Issued to Employees, or APB 25, and required     that compensation cost relating to share-based payment     transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the     fair value for all awards granted after the date of adoption as     well as for existing awards for which the requisite service had     not been rendered as of the date of adoption.         The Company adopted SFAS 123R effective January 1,     2006 and selected the Black-Scholes method of valuation to     determine the fair value of share-based payments. The Company     applied the modified prospective application method under which     the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new awards and to     awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption     date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the     awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered     that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in     the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining     service period after the adoption date based on the original     estimate of the fair value of the award. SFAS 123R required     that compensation costs be recognized based on the estimated     number of awards expected to vest. Changes in the estimated     forfeiture rates are reflected prospectively.         Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company applied the     intrinsic-value method of accounting for share-based     compensation prescribed by APB 25, and related interpretations.     As such, compensation expense for grants of stock options to     employees or members of the Board of Directors were recorded on     the date of grant only if the current market price of the     Companys common stock exceeded the exercise price.     SFAS 123 established accounting and disclosure requirements     using a fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based     employee compensation plans. As permitted by SFAS 123, the     Company elected to continue to apply the intrinsic-value-based     method of APB 25 described above, and adopted only the     disclosure requirements of SFAS 123, as amended by     SFAS No. 148, Accounting For Stock-Based     Compensation  Transition and Disclosure.        F-11    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net     income per common share applicable to common stockholders for     the year ended December 31, 2005 as if the Company had     applied the fair value recognition provisions for share-based     compensation of SFAS 123, as amended:                                  2005                   Net income as reported            $       63,656              Add: share-based employee compensation expense included in     reported income, net of tax                (143       )          Less: share-based employee compensation expense determined under     fair-value-based method (net of tax)                (52,746       )                                Basic pro forma net income            $       10,767              Interest expense on convertible debt, net of tax                5,571                                    Diluted pro forma net income            $       16,338                                    Net income per common share:                           Basic, as reported            $       0.19              Basic, pro forma            $       0.03              Diluted, as reported            $       0.18              Diluted, pro forma            $       0.03             Earnings Per Share:  Basic earnings per share     is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average     number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted     earnings per share is computed by dividing net income adjusted     to add back the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the     period associated with any convertible debt issuance that is     determined to be dilutive by the weighted-average number of     common shares outstanding during the period increased to include     all additional common shares that would have been outstanding as     if the outstanding convertible debt was converted into shares of     common stock and assuming potentially dilutive common shares,     resulting from option exercises, had been issued and any     proceeds thereof used to repurchase common stock at the average     market price during the period. The proceeds used to repurchase     common stock are assumed to be the sum of the amount to be paid     to the Company upon exercise of options, the amount of     compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet     recognized and, if applicable, the amount of excess income tax     benefit that would be credited to paid-in capital upon exercise.     Comprehensive Income:  The components of     comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in currency     translation adjustments, changes in the minimum pension     liability and the after-tax effects of changes in net unrealized     gains (losses) on marketable securities classified as available     for sale.

Capitalized software costs are     included in property, plant and equipment, net and are amortized     over their estimated useful life of three to five years from the     date the systems are ready for their intended use.     New Accounting Principles:  In February 2006,     the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for     Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments  an amendment of     FASB Statements No. 133 and 140, or SFAS 155,     which permits a fair value re-measurement for any hybrid     financial instrument which contains an embedded derivative that     would otherwise require bifurcation. The Company adopted the     provisions of SFAS 155 effective January 1, 2007 and     determined that it had no impact on its consolidated financial     statements.         In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,     or FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income     Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement     No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for     uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises     financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,     Accounting for Income Taxes, and prescribes a     recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the     financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax     position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.     FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,     classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim     periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the     provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007 and had     no cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption. Refer     to Note 16, Income Taxes, for additional     information.         On May 2, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position     FIN 48-1,     or FSP     FIN 48-1,     Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation     No. 48. FSP     FIN 48-1     provides guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether     a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of     recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The Company     retroactively adopted the provisions of FSP     FIN 48-1     effective January 1, 2007 and has determined that it had no     impact on its consolidated financial statements.         In December 2006, the FASB issued FSP EITF Issue     No. 00-19-2,     Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements, or     FSP 00-19-2,     which addresses an issuers accounting for registration     payment arrangements.     FSP 00-19-2     specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments     or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment     arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included     as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement,     should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with     SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.     FSP 00-19-2     was issued in December 2006 and was effective immediately for     registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments     subject to those arrangements that were entered into or modified     subsequent to the issuance of     FSP 00-19-2.     For registration payment arrangements and financial instruments     subject to those arrangements that were entered into prior to     the issuance of     FSP 00-19-2,     it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years     beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted the     provisions of     FSP 00-19-2     effective January 1, 2007 and has determined that it had no     impact on its consolidated financial statements. Refer to     Note 9, Convertible Debt, for additional     information.        F-13    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,     Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS 157, which     establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands     disclosures about fair value measurements. The FASB partially     deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial     assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair     value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis while     the effective date for nonfinancial and financial assets and     liabilities that are recognized on a recurring basis is     effective beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has     determined that the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a     material impact on its consolidated financial statements.         In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,     The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial     Liabilities, or SFAS 159, which provides companies     with an option to report selected financial assets and     liabilities at fair value. SFAS 159s objective is to     improve financial reporting by providing entities with the     opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused     by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without     having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This     Statement is expected to expand the use of fair value     measurement, which is consistent with the Boards long-term     measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments.     SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure     requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between     companies that choose different measurement attributes for     similar types of assets and liabilities and highlight the effect     of a companys choice to use fair value on its earnings. It     also requires a company to display the fair value of those     assets and liabilities for which it has chosen to use fair value     on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS 159 will be     effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. The     Company has determined that the adoption of SFAS 159 will     not have a material impact on its consolidated financial     statements.         In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue     No. 07-3,     Accounting for Non-Refundable Advance Payments for Goods     or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development     Activities, or     EITF 07-3,     which provides that non-refundable advance payments for future     research and development activities should be deferred and     capitalized until the related goods are delivered or the related     services are performed.     EITF 07-3     will be effective for the Company on a prospective basis     beginning January 1, 2008 and evaluated on a contract by     contract basis.         In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue     No. 07-1,     Accounting for Collaboration Arrangements Related to the     Development and Commercialization of Intellectual     Property, or     EITF 07-1,     which provides guidance on how the parties to a collaborative     agreement should account for costs incurred and revenue     generated on sales to third parties, how sharing payments     pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the     income statement and certain related disclosure requirements.     EITF 07-01     will be effective for the Company beginning January 2009 on a     retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the     impact of the adoption of     EITF 07-1     will have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.           (2)     Proposed     Merger with Pharmion Corporation           On November 18, 2007, the Company entered into a merger     agreement to acquire Pharmion Corporation, or Pharmion, under     which Pharmion will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the     Company. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase.     Under the purchase method of accounting for business     combinations, the assets and liabilities of Pharmion will be     recorded at their fair values on the acquisition date.         Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Pharmion     common stock will be converted into the right to receive     (i) that number of shares of Celgene common stock equal to     the quotient, which we refer to as the exchange ratio,     determined by dividing $47.00 by the volume weighted average     price per share of Celgene common stock (rounded to the nearest     cent) on The Nasdaq Global Select Market for the 15 consecutive     trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day     immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which we     refer to as the measurement price; provided, however, that if     the measurement price is less than $56.15, each share of     Pharmion common stock will be converted into the right to     receive 0.8370 shares of Celgene common stock and if the     measurement price is greater than $72.93, each share of        F-14    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         Pharmion common stock will be converted into the right to     receive 0.6445 shares of Celgene common stock and     (ii) $25.00 in cash, without interest. Each outstanding     unvested option to purchase shares of Pharmion common stock will     be converted into an unvested option to acquire such number of     shares of Celgene common stock equal to the product of     (i) the number of shares of Pharmion common stock subject     to such option immediately prior to the effective time of the     merger and (ii) the option exchange ratio, as defined in     the merger agreement. Each outstanding vested option to purchase     shares of Pharmion common stock will be canceled and will     entitle the holder to receive only the consideration (subject to     all applicable income and employment withholding taxes) such     holder would have received if such holder had effected a     cashless exercise of such vested option to purchase Pharmion     common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the     merger, and the shares of Pharmion common stock issued upon such     cashless exercise were converted in the merger into the     consideration to be received by the Pharmion stockholders     described above. Restricted stock units held under     Pharmions equity compensation plans will become fully     vested immediately prior to the effective time of the merger     and, subject to applicable income and employment withholding     taxes, will be canceled as of the effective time of the merger     and converted into the right to receive the per share merger     consideration to be received by holders of shares of Pharmion     common stock as described above. Pharmion stockholders will not     receive any fractional shares of Celgene common stock in the     merger. Instead, any stockholder who would otherwise be entitled     to a fractional share of Celgene common stock will be entitled     to receive an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole     cent), without interest, equal to the product of such fraction     multiplied by the measurement price.         The boards of directors of Pharmion and Celgene have unanimously     approved the merger and merger agreement. Completion of the     merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including     approval of the merger by the stockholders of Pharmion and     contains customary representations, warrants and covenants made     by Pharmion and the Company. Upon completion of the merger, the     Celgenes stockholders are expected to own approximately     93% of the combined company and Pharmion stockholders are     expected to own approximately 7% of the combined company, on a     fully diluted basis. The     Hart-Scott-Rodino     Act, or HSR, thirty day waiting period has expired without the     United States Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requesting     additional information with regard to the merger. In addition,     the Bundeskartellamt, Germanys Federal Cartel Office in     charge of reviewing the antitrust aspects of mergers and     acquisitions, has cleared Celgenes pending acquisition of     Pharmion Corporation. On February 5, 2008 the     Form S-4     relating to the merger of Pharmion and Celgene was declared     effective by the SEC. The merger is expected to be completed in     March 2008 following approval of a majority of Pharmion     shareholders. Either party may be obligated to pay a termination     fee of $70.0 million if the merger agreement is terminated     under certain circumstances.         Through December 31, 2007, we have capitalized     $7.5 million of costs relating to legal, financial and     accounting advisory services performed in connection with the     proposed merger with Pharmion, which are included in other     assets in the accompanying balance sheet.

U.S. government-sponsored agency securities include general     unsecured obligations of the issuing agency. Private cash fund     shares are investments in enhanced cash comingled funds. Other     asset-backed securities are securities backed by collateral     other than mortgage obligations. Unrealized losses for     mortgage-backed obligations, U.S. Treasury securities and     U.S. government-sponsored agency securities were primarily     due to increases in interest rates. Unrealized losses for     corporate debt were due to increases in interest rates as well     as widening credit spreads. The Company has sufficient liquidity     and intends to hold these securities with unrealized losses     until the market value recovers.

(3)         Under a license agreement between EntreMed and Royalty Pharma     Finance Trust, EntreMed is entitled to share in the     THALOMID®     royalty payments that the Company pays to Royalty Pharma on     annual     THALOMID®     sales above a certain threshold. As prescribed by the equity     method of accounting, the Companys share of     EntreMeds royalties, based on its ownership percentage in     EntreMed, is eliminated from cost of goods sold and reflected in     equity in losses of affiliated companies.          The fair value of the Companys common stock investment in     EntreMed, Inc. at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was     $12.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively.

The transaction included a technical service     agreement which allows the Company to retain the necessary     support to operate the plant. The assets were purchased for a     U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately     $46.0 million, consisting of payment of       F-19    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         approximately $12.4 million at the closing,     $3.4 million payable in each of the first five following     years and $3.3 million in each of the subsequent five     years. The present value of the note payable was a     U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately,     $26.2 million at December 31, 2007, of which     $3.5 million, representing the amount due within one-year,     was included in other current liabilities with the remainder     included in other non-current liabilities. The Company imputed     interest on the note payable using the effective yield method     with a discount rate of 7.68%. At December 31, 2007,     payments totaling a U.S. dollar equivalency of     approximately $17.7 million due over years 6 to 10 are     forgiven if, pursuant to its right, the Company elects to sell     the facility back to Siegfried.           (9)     Convertible     Debt           In June 2003, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount     of $400.0 million of unsecured convertible notes due June     2008. The notes have a five-year term and a coupon rate of 1.75%     payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. Each $1,000     principal amount of convertible notes is convertible into     82.5592 shares of common stock as adjusted, or a conversion     price of $12.1125 per share, which represented a 50% premium to     the closing price on May 28, 2003 of the Companys     common stock of $8.075 per share, after adjusting prices for the     two-for-one     stock splits affected on February 17, 2006 and     October 22, 2004. The debt issuance costs related to these     convertible notes, which totaled approximately     $12.2 million, are classified under other assets on the     consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized over five     years. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the     noteholders at December 31, 2007 can convert the     outstanding notes at any time into 16,227,441 shares of     common stock at the conversion price. In addition, the     noteholders have the right to require the Company to redeem the     notes in cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount     to be redeemed, plus accrued interest, prior to maturity in the     event of a change of control and certain other transactions     defined as a fundamental change in the indenture     governing the notes. Subsequent to the September 2003 issuance     date, $203.4 million of principal has been converted into     16,796,239 shares of common stock.         The Companys convertible notes are classified as current     liabilities due to their maturity in June 2008. Based on the     price of the Companys common stock at December 31,     2007, the Company expects the remaining noteholders to convert     the notes into shares of common stock and does not expect such     conversion to have a material impact on its financial condition,     liquidity or capital resources.         At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the fair     value of the Companys convertible notes outstanding     exceeded the carrying value of $196.6 million and     $399.9 million by approximately $514.4 million and     $1,507.1 million, respectively.         Under the Registration Rights Agreement for the notes, the     Company could be subject to liquidated damages if the     effectiveness of the registration statement covering the     convertible debt is not maintained at any time prior to the     earlier of: (i) two years after the conversion of the last     convertible note into common stock or (ii) September 2010.     The Company believes the likelihood of occurrence of such event     is remote and, as such, the Company has not recorded a liability     for liquidated damages at December 31, 2007. In the     unlikely event that it becomes probable that the Company would     have to pay liquidated damages under the Registration Rights     Agreement, the Company has estimated the maximum potential     liquidated damages as of December 31, 2007 to be     approximately $2.0 million per year.         Such damages (a) would accrue only with respect to the     shares of the Companys common stock (underlying the notes)     that were not already sold by the holder (under the registration     statement or pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the     Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and that were not eligible     for sale without a registration statement, (b) would accrue     only for the period during which the registration statement was     not effective, subsequent to its initial effectiveness and     (c) would be settled in cash in accordance with the terms     of the Registration Rights Agreement.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets was approximately     $9.5 million, $9.0 million and $2.1 million for     the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,     respectively. Assuming no changes in the gross carrying amount     of intangible assets, the amortization of intangible assets for     the next five fiscal years is estimated to be approximately     $9.4 million per year.     Goodwill:  At December 31, 2007, the     Companys recorded goodwill related to the acquisition of     Penn T on October 21, 2004. The changes in the carrying     value of goodwill are summarized as follows:                               Balance, December 31, 2005            $       33,815              Foreign currency translation                4,679                                    Balance, December 31, 2006            $       38,494              Foreign currency translation                539                                    Balance, December 31, 2007            $       39,033                                         (11)     Related     Party Transactions           Under a license agreement between EntreMed and Royalty Pharma     Finance Trust, EntreMed is entitled to share in the     THALOMID®     royalty payments that the Company pays to Royalty Pharma on     annual     THALOMID®     sales in the United States above a certain threshold. The     Companys share of EntreMeds royalties, based on its     ownership percentage in EntreMed, is eliminated from cost of     goods sold and reflected in equity in losses of affiliated     companies (refer to Note 7).         In March 2005, the Company licensed to EntreMed rights to     develop and commercialize its tubulin inhibitor compounds. Under     the terms of the agreement, Celgene received an up-front license     payment of $1.0 million and is entitled to additional     payments upon successful completion of certain clinical,     regulatory        F-21    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         and sales milestones. Under the agreement, EntreMed will provide     all resources needed to conduct clinical research and regulatory     activities associated with seeking marketing approvals of the     tubulin inhibitors for oncology applications.           (12)     Stockholders     Equity       Preferred Stock:  The Board of Directors is     authorized to issue, at any time, without further stockholder     approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to     determine the price, rights, privileges, and preferences of such     shares.     Common Stock:  At December 31, 2007, the     Company was authorized to issue up to 575,000,000 shares of     common stock. At December 31, 2007, shares of common stock     issued totaled 407,150,694.     Treasury Stock:  During 2007, 2006 and 2005,     certain employees exercised stock options containing a reload     feature and, pursuant to the Companys stock option plan,     tendered 106,517, 2,348,010 and 1,932,154 stock split-adjusted     mature shares, respectively, related to stock option exercises.     Such tendered shares are reflected as treasury stock. At     December 31, 2007, treasury shares totaled 4,026,116.         A summary of changes in common stock issued and treasury stock     is presented below after adjustments of the     two-for-one     stock split in February 2006:                                                          Common Stock                  Common Stock           in Treasury                   December 31, 2004                330,158,396                   (21,128       )          Exercise of stock options and warrants                13,700,750                                 Issuance of common stock for employee benefit plans                264,692                                 Treasury stock  mature shares tendered related to     option exercises                                   (1,932,154       )          Conversion of long-term convertible notes                1,320                                                                       December 31, 2005                344,125,158                   (1,953,282       )                                                Exercise of stock options and warrants                15,839,310                   42,575              Issuance of common stock for employee benefit plans                                   201,164              Treasury stock  mature shares tendered related to     option exercises                                   (2,348,010       )          Conversion of long-term convertible notes                7,841                                 Issuance of restricted stock                120,000                                 Issuance of common stock in connection with public offering                20,000,000                                                                       December 31, 2006                380,092,309                   (4,057,553       )                                                Exercise of stock options and warrants                10,271,307                                 Issuance of common stock for employee benefit plans                                   137,954              Treasury stock  mature shares tendered related to     option exercises                                   (106,517       )          Conversion of long-term convertible notes                16,787,078                                                                       December 31, 2007                407,150,694                   (4,026,116       )                                               Rights Plan:  During 1996, the Company adopted     a shareholder rights plan, or Rights Plan. The Rights Plan     involves the distribution of one right as a dividend on each     outstanding share of the Companys common stock to each     holder of record on September 26, 1996. Each right entitles     the holder to purchase one-tenth of a        F-22    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         share of common stock. The rights trade in tandem with the     common stock until, and are exercisable upon, certain triggering     events, and the exercise price is based on the estimated     long-term value of the Companys common stock. In certain     circumstances, the Rights Plan permits the holders to purchase     shares of the Companys common stock at a discounted rate.     The Companys Board of Directors retains the right at all     times prior to acquisition of 15% of the Companys voting     common stock by an acquirer, to discontinue the Rights Plan     through the redemption of all rights or to amend the Rights Plan     in any respect. The Rights Plan, as amended on February 17,     2000, increased the exercise price per right from $100.00 to     $700.00 and extended the final expiration date of the Rights     Plan to February 17, 2010. On August 13, 2003, the     Rights Plan was further amended to permit a qualified     institutional investor to beneficially own up to 17% of the     Companys common stock outstanding without being deemed an     acquiring person, if such institutional investor     meets certain requirements.           (13)     Share-Based     Compensation           The Company has a shareholder approved 1998 Stock Incentive     Plan, or the 1998 Incentive Plan, that provides for the granting     of options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights,     performance awards and other share-based awards to employees and     officers of the Company. The aggregate number of shares of     common stock that may be subject to awards under the 1998 Plan     is 84,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment under certain     circumstances. The Management Compensation and Development     Committee of the Board of Directors, or the Compensation     Committee, may determine the type, amount and terms, including     vesting, of any awards made under the Incentive Plan. Effective     August 22, 2007, the Company amended the 1998 Incentive     Plan to provide for continued vesting of stock options and stock     appreciation rights, granted on or after September 1, 2007,     during the three-year period following a participants     retirement (as defined in the 1998 Incentive Plan),     provided that the Compensation Committee under the 1998     Incentive Plan or its designee receives not less than six months     written notice of the participants intent to retire. The     1998 Incentive Plan will terminate in 2008.         With respect to options granted under the 1998 Incentive Plan,     the exercise price may not be less than the market price of the     common stock on the date of grant. In general, options granted     under the 1998 Incentive Plan vest over periods ranging from     immediate vesting to four-year vesting and expire ten years from     the date of grant, subject to earlier expiration in case of     termination of employment unless the participant meets the     retirement provision under which the option would have a maximum     of three additional years to vest. The vesting period for     options granted under the 1998 Incentive Plan is subject to     certain acceleration provisions if a change in control, as     defined in the 1998 Incentive Plan, occurs. Plan participants     may elect to exercise options at any time during the option     term. However, any shares so purchased which have not vested as     of the date of exercise shall be subject to forfeiture, which     will lapse in accordance with the established vesting time     period.         In June 1995, the stockholders of the Company approved the 1995     Non-Employee Directors Incentive Plan, or the 1995     Incentive Plan, which, as amended, provides for the granting of     non-qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of not more     than 7,700,000 shares of common stock (subject to     adjustment under certain circumstances) to directors of the     Company who are not officers or employees of the Company, or     Non-Employee Directors. Effective June 12, 2007, the     Company amended the 1995 Incentive Plan to increase the number     of options to purchase common stock granted to each new     Non-Employee Director, from 20,000 to 25,000 and to increase the     quarterly grants of options from 3,750 (15,000 annually) to     4,625 (18,500 annually). The 1995 Incentive Plan also provides     for a discretionary grant upon the date of each annual meeting     of an additional option to purchase up to 5,000 shares to a     Non-Employee Director who serves as a member (but not a     chairman) of a committee of the Board of Directors and an option     to purchase up to 10,000 shares to a Non-Employee Director     who serves as the chairman of a committee of the Board of     Directors. All options are granted at an exercise price that     equals the closing market price of the Companys        F-23    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         common stock at the grant date and expire ten years after the     date of grant. The 1995 Incentive Plan will terminate on     June 30, 2015.         As a result of the acquisition of Anthrogenesis in December     2002, we acquired the Anthrogenesis Qualified Employee Incentive     Stock Option Plan and the Non-Qualified Recruiting and Retention     Stock Option Plan. Neither plan has been approved by our     stockholders. No future awards will be granted under either     plan. Stock options issued and outstanding under both plans are     fully vested at December 31, 2007.         Shares of common stock available for future share-based grants     under all plans were 15,944,719 at December 31, 2007.         The following table summarizes the components of share-based     compensation cost charged to the consolidated statements of     operations for years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:                                              2007           2006                   Cost of goods sold            $       2,060               $       1,637              Research and development                16,685                   12,740              Selling, general and administrative                35,274                   62,266              Other income and expense, net                4,806                                                                       Total share-based compensation expense            $       58,825               $       76,643              Tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense                10,220                   23,447                                                    Reduction in net income            $       48,605               $       53,196                                                    Reduction in earnings per share:                                           Basic            $       0.13               $       0.15              Diluted            $       0.11               $       0.13                 Included in share-based compensation expense for the years ended     December 31, 2007 and 2006 was compensation expense related     to non-qualified stock options of $34.0 and $57.2 million,     respectively.         Share-based compensation cost included in inventory was     $0.4 million at December 31, 2007. The inventory     balance at December 31, 2006 did not include any     share-based compensation. As of December 31, 2007, there     was $184.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost     related to stock options granted under the plans. That cost will     be recognized over an expected remaining weighted-average period     of 2.2 years.         SFAS 123R, which replaced SFAS 123, and superseded APB     25, requires that compensation cost relating to share-based     payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based     on the fair value for all awards granted after the date of     adoption as well as for existing awards for which the requisite     service has not been rendered as of the date of adoption.         The Company adopted SFAS 123R effective January 1,     2006 and selected the Black-Scholes method of valuation to     determine the fair value of share-based payments. The Company     applied the modified prospective application method under which     the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new awards and to     awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption     date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the     awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered     that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in     the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining     service period after the adoption date based on the original     estimate of the fair value of the award. The modified     prospective transition method as prescribed by SFAS 123R     does not require restatement of prior periods to reflect the     impact of adopting SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R requires     compensation costs to be recognized based on the estimated     number of awards expected to vest. Changes in the estimated     forfeiture rates are reflected prospectively.        F-24    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         In computing the initial APIC Pool of excess tax benefits, the     Company applied the methodology described in paragraph 81     of SFAS 123R. Paragraph 81 of SFAS 123R prohibits     recognition of a deferred tax asset for excess tax benefits that     have not been realized. The Company has adopted the tax law     method as its accounting policy regarding the ordering of tax     benefits to determine whether an excess tax benefit has been     realized.         Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented     all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of     stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated     Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires excess tax     benefits (i.e., the tax benefit recognized upon exercise of     stock options in excess of the benefit recognized from     recognizing compensation cost for those options) to be     classified as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statement     of Cash Flows. Cash received from stock option exercises for the     years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was     $144.7 million and $113.1 million, respectively, and     the excess tax benefit recognized was $143.0 million and     $102.0 million, respectively. Cash received from stock     option exercises for the year ended December 31, 2005 was     $52.6 million. Pursuant to SFAS 123R, tax benefits     resulting from the exercise of stock options, which have been     presented as operating cash flows prior to the adoption of     SFAS 123R are not reclassified to financing activities, but     rather shall continue to be presented as operating cash flows.         The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the stock options     granted during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and     2005 was $24.54 per share, $17.54 per share and     $9.60 share. The Company estimated the fair value of     options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with     the following assumptions:                                        2007       2006       2005               Risk-free interest rate            3.45% - 5.00%           4.50% - 5.24%           3.37% - 4.62%          Expected volatility            37% - 43%           40% - 52%           40% - 41%          Weighted average expected volatility            38%           47%           41%          Expected term (years)            2.9 - 4.9           3.1 - 5.0           3.5 - 4.5          Expected dividend yield            0%           0%           0%             The fair value of stock options granted after January 1,     2006 is allocated to compensation cost on a straight-line basis.     The fair value of stock options granted before January 1,     2006 is recognized over the attribution period using the graded     vesting attribution approach. Compensation cost is allocated     over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are     generally the vesting periods.         The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury     zero-coupon curve. Expected volatility of stock option awards is     estimated based on the implied volatility of the Companys     publicly traded options with settlement dates of six months. The     use of implied volatility was based upon the availability of     actively traded options on the Companys common stock and     the assessment that implied volatility is more representative of     future stock price trends than historical volatility. Prior to     the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company calculated expected     volatility using only historical stock price volatility. The     expected term of an employee share option is the period of time     for which the option is expected to be outstanding. The Company     has made a determination of expected term by analyzing     employees historical exercise experience from its history     of grants and exercises in the Companys option database     and management estimates. Forfeiture rates are estimated based     on historical data.         In December 2005, the Board of Directors approved a resolution     to grant the 2006 annual stock option awards under the 1998     Incentive Stock Plan in 2005. All stock options awarded were     granted fully vested. Half of the options granted had an     exercise price of $34.05 per option, which was at a 5% premium     to the closing price of the Companys common stock of     $32.43 per share on the grant date of December 29, 2005;     the remaining options granted had an exercise price of $35.67     per option, which was at a 10% premium to the closing price of     the Companys common stock of $32.43 per share on the grant     date of December 29, 2005.        F-25    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         The Boards decision to grant these options was in     recognition of the     REVLIMID®     regulatory approval and in response to a review of the     Companys long-term incentive compensation programs. As     these options were granted prior to the adoption of     SFAS 123R, they were accounted for under APB 25, and     resulted in the Company not being required to recognize     cumulative compensation expense of approximately     $70.8 million for the four-year period ending     December 31, 2009.         Stock option transactions for the year ended December 31,     2005 under all plans are as follows:                                                                      Options Outstanding                                         Weighted                                          Average                  Options                        Exercise                  Available                        Price per                  For Grant           Options           Option                   Balance December 31, 2004                1,921,399                   25,264,718               $       15.15              Authorized                6,250,000                                                    Granted                (7,302,665       )               7,302,665                   54.32              Exercised                                   (6,840,682       )               11.16              Cancelled                405,262                   (429,512       )               23.72              Stock split impact                1,273,996                   25,297,189                                                                                       Balance December 31, 2005                2,547,992                   50,594,378               $       13.70                                                                       Stock option transactions for the years ended December 31,     2007 and 2006 under all plans are as follows:                                                                                  Weighted            Weighted                                          Average            Average                                          Exercise            Remaining            Aggregate                              Price per            Contractual            Intrinsic                  Options           Option           Term (years)           Value                                                     (In thousands)                   Outstanding at December 31, 2005                50,594,378               $       13.70                   6.9               $       909,083              Changes during the Year:                                                                           Granted                3,705,816                   43.86                                              Exercised                (15,839,310       )               10.08                                              Forfeited                (1,251,915       )               14.94                                              Expired                (97,281       )               11.71                                                                                                                    Outstanding at December 31, 2006                37,111,688               $       18.18                   6.0               $       959,600                                                                                    Changes during the Year:                                                                           Granted                6,719,342                   61.71                                              Exercised                (10,271,307       )               14.30                                              Forfeited                (834,095       )               30.22                                              Expired                (8,194       )               45.88                                                                                                                    Outstanding at December 31, 2007                32,717,434               $       28.03                   6.1               $       702,341                                                                                    Vested or expected to vest at December 31, 2007                31,925,344               $       27.55                   6.0               $       695,418                                                                                    Vested at December 31, 2007                21,941,442               $       19.25                   4.8               $       597,971                                                                                       The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the     years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was     $470.5 million, $540.3 million and     $243.4 million, respectively.

The reload stock option     is exercisable on the same terms and conditions as apply to the     original stock option except that (x) the reload stock     option will become exercisable in full on the day which is six     months after the date the original stock option is exercised,     (y) the exercise price shall be the fair value (as defined     in the 1998 Incentive Plan) of the common stock on the date the     reload stock option is granted and (z) the expiration of     the reload stock option will be the date of expiration of the     original stock option. As of December 31, 2007, the Company     has issued 10,876,300 stock options to executives that contain     the reload features noted above, of which 827,186 options are     still outstanding. The 1998 Incentive Plan was amended to     eliminate the reload feature for all stock options granted on or     after October 1, 2004.     Warrants:  In connection with its acquisition     of Anthrogenesis, the Company assumed the Anthrogenesis warrants     outstanding, which were converted into warrants to purchase     867,356 shares of the Companys common stock.     Anthrogenesis had issued warrants to investors at exercise     prices equivalent to the per share price of their investment. As     of December 31, 2007, Celgene had 378,652 warrants     outstanding to acquire an equivalent number of shares of Celgene     common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.94 per     warrant. Although none of the warrants were exercised in 2007,     warrant exercises totaled 26,044, and 19,388 in 2006 and 2005,     respectively. These warrants expire on various dates from 2008     to 2012.           (14)     Employee     Benefit Plans           The Company sponsors an employees savings and retirement     plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal     Revenue Code, as amended, for its U.S. employees. The     Companys contributions to the savings        F-27    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         plan are discretionary and have historically been made in the     form of the Companys common stock. Such contributions are     based on specified percentages of employee contributions up to     6% of base salary or a maximum permitted by law. Total expense     for contributions to the U.S. savings plans were     $5.4 million, $8.2 million and $6.5 million in     2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company also sponsors     defined contribution plans in certain foreign locations.     Participation in these plans is subject to the local laws that     are in effect for each country and may include statutorily     imposed minimum contributions. The Company maintains a defined     benefit plan for certain employees in France. The obligation at     December 31, 2007 and the net periodic pension cost for the     year ended December 31, 2007 for this plan were immaterial.         During 2000, the Companys Board of Directors approved a     deferred compensation plan effective September 1, 2000. In     February 2005, the Companys Board of Directors adopted the     Celgene Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, effective     as of January 1, 2005, and amended the plan in February     2008. This plan operates as the Companys ongoing deferred     compensation plan and is intended to comply with the American     Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which added new Section 409A to     the Internal Revenue Code, changing the income tax treatment,     design and administration of certain plans that provide for the     deferral of compensation. The Companys Board of Directors     froze the 2000 deferred compensation plan, effective as of     December 31, 2004, and no additional contributions or     deferrals can be made to that plan. Accrued benefits under the     frozen plan will continue to be governed by the terms under the     tax laws in effect prior to the enactment of Section 409A.     Eligible participants, which include certain top-level     executives of the Company as specified by the plan, can elect to     defer up to an amended 90% of the participants base     salary, 100% of cash bonuses and restricted stock and stock     options gains (both subject to a minimum deferral of 50% of each     award of restricted stock or stock option gain approved by the     Compensation Committee for deferral). Company contributions to     the deferred compensation plan represent a match of the     participants deferral up to a specified percentage     (ranging from 10% to 25%, depending on the employees     position as specified in the plan) of the participants     base salary. The Company recorded expense of $0.6 million,     $0.5 million and $0.4 million related to the deferred     compensation plans in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The     Companys recurring matches are fully vested, upon     contribution. All other Company contributions to the plan do not     vest until the specified requirements are met. At     December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had a deferred     compensation liability included in other non-current liabilities     in the consolidated balance sheets of approximately     $21.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively, which     included the participants elected deferral of salaries and     bonuses, the Companys matching contribution and earnings     on deferred amounts as of that date. The plan provides various     alternatives for the measurement of earnings on the amounts     participants defer under the plan. The measuring alternatives     are based on returns of a variety of funds that offer plan     participants the option to spread their risk across a diverse     group of investments.         The Company has established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP,     designed to provide key officers and executives with     performance-based incentive opportunities contingent upon     achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives     covering a three-year period. The Company currently has three     3-year     performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31,     2008, 2009 and 2010. The 2008 performance cycle was approved by     the Management Compensation and Development Committee of the     Board of Directors on February 4, 2008 and began on     January 1, 2008 with an ending date of December 31,     2010. Performance measures for the Plans are based on the     following components in the last year of the     3-year     cycle: 25% on earnings per share, 25% on net income and 50% on     revenue.         Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the     participants salary for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 Plans. The     estimated payout for the concluded 2007 Plan is     $6.2 million, which is included in other current     liabilities at December 31, 2007, and the maximum potential     payout, assuming maximum objectives are achieved for the 2008,     2009 and 2010 Plans are $6.4 million, $8.0 million and     $10.0 million, respectively. Such awards are payable in     cash or, at its discretion, the Company can elect to pay the     same value in its common stock based upon the Companys     stock price at the payout date. The Company accrues the     long-term incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior     to the end of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an        F-28    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         estimate of the Companys level of achievement during the     cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled     to an immediate payment equal to their target award, or, if     higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of     the change in control. For the years ended December 31,     2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized expense related to     the LTIP of $6.9 million, $4.6 million and     $4.4 million, respectively.           (15)     Sponsored     Research, License and Other Agreements       Array BioPharma Inc.:  In September 2007, the     Company entered into a research collaboration agreement with     Array BioPharma Inc., or Array, focused on the discovery,     development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in     cancer and inflammation. As part of this agreement, the Company     made an upfront payment of $40.0 million, which was     recorded as research and development expense, to Array in return     for an option to receive exclusive worldwide rights for certain     mutually selected discovery target drugs developed under the     collaboration, except for Arrays limited     U.S. co-promotional rights. Array will be responsible for     all discovery and clinical development through Phase I or Phase     IIa and be entitled to receive, for each drug, potential     milestone payments of approximately $200.0 million, if     certain discovery, development and regulatory milestones are     achieved and $300.0 million if certain commercial     milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on net sales.     PTC Therapeutics, Inc.:  In September 2007, the     Company invested $20.0 million, of which $1.1 million     represented research and development expense, in Series 1     Convertible Preferred Stock of PTC Therapeutics, Inc., or PTC,     and also entered into a separate collaboration agreement whereby     PTC would perform discovery research activities. If both parties     subsequently agree to advance research on certain discovery     targets, a separate research agreement would be negotiated.     Pharmion:  In November 2001, the Company     licensed to Pharmion Corporation exclusive rights relating to     the development and commercial use of its intellectual property     covering thalidomide and     S.T.E.P.S®.     Under the terms of the agreement, the Company receives a royalty     of 8% of Pharmions net thalidomide sales in countries     where Pharmion has received regulatory approval and a     S.T.E.P.S®     license fee of 8% in all other licensed territories. In December     2004, following the Companys acquisition of Penn T     Limited, the Company entered into an amended thalidomide supply     agreement with Pharmion whereby, in exchange for a reduction in     Pharmions purchase price of thalidomide to 15.5% of its     net sales of thalidomide, the Company received a one-time     payment of 39.6 million British pounds sterling, or     U.S. dollar equivalency of $77.0 million. Under the     December 2004 agreement, as amended, the Company also received a     one-time payment of $3.0 million in return for granting     license rights to Pharmion to develop and market thalidomide in     additional territories and eliminating certain of its license     termination rights. Under a separate letter agreement     simultaneously entered into by the parties, Pharmion has also     agreed to provide the Company with an aggregate     $8.0 million over a three-year period commencing     January 1, 2005, and ending December 31, 2007, to     support the two companies existing thalidomide research     and development efforts.         Pursuant to     EITF 00-21,     the Company has determined that the Pharmion agreements     constitute a single unit of accounting and pursuant to     SAB No. 104, the Company has recorded the payments     received as deferred revenue and is amortizing such payments on     a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of     13 years, which is the estimated life of the supply     agreement. All payments under the thalidomide research and     development letter agreement have been received and are     amortized over the remaining useful life of the supply agreement.     Novartis Pharma AG:  In April 2000, the Company     entered into an agreement with Novartis in which the Company     granted to Novartis an exclusive worldwide license (excluding     Canada) to develop and market     FOCALINtm     (d-methylphenidate, or d-MPH) and FOCALIN     XRtm,     the long-acting drug formulation. The Company has retained the     exclusive commercial rights to     FOCALINtm     and FOCALIN     XRtm     for oncology-related disorders, such as chronic fatigue     associated with chemotherapy. The Company also granted Novartis        F-29    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         rights to all of its related intellectual property and patents,     including new formulations of the currently marketed     RITALIN®.     Under the agreement, the Company has received upfront and     regulatory achievement milestone payments totaling     $55.0 million and is entitled to additional payments upon     attainment of certain other milestone events.

As of December 31,     2007, we have not made a U.S. tax provision on     $590.0 million of unremitted earnings of our international     subsidiaries. These earnings are expected to be reinvested     overseas indefinitely. It is not practicable to compute the     estimated deferred tax liability on these earnings.         The Company operates under an incentive tax holiday in     Switzerland that expires in 2015 and exempts the Company from     certain Swiss income taxes.         Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between     financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as     temporary differences. The Company records the tax     effect on these temporary differences as deferred tax     assets (generally items that can be used as a tax     deduction or credit in future periods) or deferred tax     liabilities (generally items for which the Company     received a tax deduction but that have not yet been recorded in     the Consolidated Statement of Operations). The Company     periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of     deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of these     deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it     believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers     many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization     of deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings     experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future     taxable income, the carryforward        F-30    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         periods available to it for tax reporting purposes, tax planning     strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is     required in making this assessment.         At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the tax effects of temporary     differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and     liabilities were as follows:                                                                      2007           2006                 Assets           Liabilities           Assets           Liabilities                   Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards            $       24,322                                  $       72,167               $                     Prepaid/deferred items                24,027                                      22,987                                 Deferred revenue                20,316                                      22,253                                 Capitalized research expenses                23,932                                      18,167                                 Research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards                38,821                                      28,979                                 Non-qualified stock options                22,646                                      23,447                                 Plant and equipment, primarily differences in depreciation                583                                      1,284                                 Inventory                2,950                                      2,685                                 Other assets                29,311                   (268       )                                  (216       )          Intangibles                18,285                   (24,783       )               2,533                   (28,850       )          Accrued and other expenses                46,320                                      41,323                                 Unrealized gains on securities                                   (43,682       )                                  (10,924       )                                                                                Subtotal                251,513                   (68,733       )               235,825                   (39,990       )          Valuation allowance                (31,926       )                                  (18,999       )                                                                                                   Total deferred taxes            $       219,587               $       (68,733       )           $       216,826               $       (39,990       )                                                                                Net deferred tax asset            $       150,854                               $       176,836                                                                                                       At December 31, 2007 and 2006, deferred tax assets and     liabilities were classified on our balance sheet as follows:                                              2007           2006                   Current assets            $       20,506               $       87,979              Other assets (non-current)                140,958                   101,048              Current liabilities                (6       )                             Other non-current liabilities                (10,604       )               (12,191       )                                                Net deferred tax asset            $       150,854               $       176,836                                                       Reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our     effective tax rate for continuing operations is as follows:                                                   Percentages        2007           2006           2005                   U.S. statutory rate                35.0       %               35.0       %               35.0       %          Foreign losses without tax benefit                12.7                   16.6                   27.2              State taxes, net of federal benefit                6.5                   9.7                   9.6              Other                1.2                   4.5                   3.2              Change in valuation allowance                0.8                   0.2                   (50.6       )                                                                Effective income tax rate                56.2       %               66.0       %               24.4       %                                                                  F-31    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         At December 31, 2007, the Company had federal net operating     loss carryforwards of approximately $288.2 million and     combined state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately     $276.6 million that will expire in the years 2008 through     2027. The Company also has research and experimentation credit     carryforwards of approximately $56.5 million that will     expire in the years 2008 through 2027. Under SFAS 123R,     excess tax benefits related to stock option deductions incurred     after December 31, 2005, are recognized in the period in     which the tax deduction is realized through a reduction of     income taxes payable. As a result, the Company has not recorded     deferred tax assets for certain stock option deductions included     in its net operating loss carryforwards and research and     experimentation credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2007,     deferred tax assets have not been recorded on federal net     operating loss carryforwards of approximately     $234.4 million, on combined state net operating loss     carryforwards of approximately $185.1 million and for     research and experimentation credits of approximately     $18.1 million. These stock option tax benefits will be     recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital when     realized.         At March 31, 2005, the Company determined it was more     likely than not that certain benefits of its deferred tax assets     would be realized based on favorable clinical data related to     REVLIMID®     (lenalidomide) during the quarter in concert with the     Companys nine consecutive quarters of profitability. This     led to the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the     Company would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the     benefits of its deferred tax assets. As a result of eliminating     the related valuation allowances, the Company recorded an income     tax benefit in 2005 of $42.6 million and an increase to     additional paid-in capital of $30.2 million. At     December 31, 2007 and 2006, it was more likely than not     that the Company would realize its deferred tax assets, net of     valuation allowances.         The Company realized stock option deduction benefits in 2007,     2006 and 2005 for income tax purposes and has increased     additional paid-in capital in the amount of approximately     $159.3 million, $114.0 million and     $103.6 million, respectively. The Company has recorded     deferred income taxes as a component of accumulated other     comprehensive income resulting in deferred income tax     liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 of     $43.7 million and $10.9 million, respectively.         The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 and FSP     FIN 48-1     effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the     accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an     enterprises financial statements in accordance with     SFAS 109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and     measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition     and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken     in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on     derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,     accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The     Company had no cumulative effect adjustment related to the     adoption.         The Companys tax returns have been audited by the Internal     Revenue Service, or IRS, through the fiscal year ended     December 31, 2003. Tax returns for the fiscal years ended     December 31, 2004 and 2005 are currently under examination     by the IRS. The Company is also subject to audits by various     state and foreign taxing authorities, including but not limited     to the major counties of Europe, the Far East, and most     U.S. states.         The Company regularly reevaluates its tax positions and the     associated interest and penalties, if applicable, resulting from     audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings, as well     as changes in tax law that would reduce the technical merits of     the position to below more likely than not. The Company believes     that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open     years. Many factors are considered in making these evaluations,     including past history, recent interpretations of tax law and     the specifics of each matter. Because tax regulations are     subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently     uncertain, these evaluations can involve a series of complex     judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates     and assumptions. The Company applies a variety of methodologies     in making these estimates and assumptions which include studies     performed by independent economists, advice from industry and     subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the     Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well     as the Companys industry experience. These evaluations are     based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed     reasonable by        F-32    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         management. However, if managements estimates are not     representative of actual outcomes, the Companys results of     operations could be materially impacted.         Unrecognized tax benefits, generally represented by liabilities     on the balance sheet, arise when the estimated benefit recorded     in the financial statements differs from the amounts taken or     expected to be taken in a tax return because of the     uncertainties described above. A reconciliation of the beginning     and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:                               Balance at January 1, 2007            $       85,258              Increases related to prior year tax positions                              Decreases related to prior year tax positions                              Increases related to current year tax positions                124,707              Settlements                              Lapses of statutes                                                    Balance at December 31, 2007            $       209,965                                       The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to     uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for income     taxes. Accrued interest at December 31, 2007 and 2006 is     approximately $5.9 million and $3.0 million,     respectively.         These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues     common among multinational corporations. If recognized, these     unrecognized tax benefits would have a net impact of     approximately $188.3 million. The liability for     unrecognized tax benefits is expected to increase in the next     twelve months relating to operations occurring in that period.     The Company does not expect a settlement of its     December 31, 2007 uncertain tax benefit balance within the     next twelve months.           (17)     Commitments     and Contingencies       Leases:  The Company leases office and research     facilities under various operating lease agreements in the     United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and Singapore.     At December 31, 2007, the non-cancelable lease terms for     the operating leases expire at various dates between 2008 and     2016 and include renewal options. In general, the Company is     also required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes,     insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs     associated with the leases.         Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating     leases as of December 31, 2007 are:                                  Operating                  Leases                   2008            $       12,094              2009                11,731              2010                10,430              2011                7,348              2012                4,467              Thereafter                4,534                                    Total minimum lease payments            $       50,604                                       Total rental expense under operating leases was approximately     $11.7 million in 2007, $7.8 million in 2006 and     $6.2 million in 2005.     Other Commitments:  The Company invested     $3.0 million in an investment fund, for an 8.6% ownership     interest. Pursuant to EITF     No. D-46,     Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments, the     Company is accounting for this investment under the equity     method of accounting. As prescribed by the equity method of        F-33    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         accounting, the Company records its share of the funds     investment gains, losses and expenses based on the percentage of     its investment balance to the total fund balance. The Company     has committed to invest an additional $17.0 million into     the fund which is callable any time within a ten-year period.     The fund will invest in     start-up     companies conducting business in life sciences such as     biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical technology, devices,     diagnostics and health and wellness. The Company recorded equity     losses of $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the years     ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for its     share of the funds expenses and at December 31, 2007,     the Companys net investment was $2.2 million.         In connection with the acquisition of Penn T, the Company     entered into a five-year minimum period Technical Services     Agreement with Penn Pharmaceutical Services Limited, or PPSL,     and Penn Pharmaceutical Holding Limited under which PPSL     provides the services and facilities necessary for the     manufacture of     THALOMID®     and other thalidomide formulations. At December 31, 2007,     the remaining costs to be incurred through October 2009 was     approximately $4.5 million.         In March 2003, the Company entered into a supply and     distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline to distribute,     promote and sell     ALKERAN®     (melphalan), a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative     treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. Under     the terms of the agreement, the Company purchases     ALKERAN®     tablets and     ALKERAN®     for infusion from GSK and distribute the products in the United     States under the Celgene label. The agreement requires the     Company to purchase certain minimum quantities each year under a     take-or-pay arrangement. The agreement has been extended through     March 31, 2009. On December 31, 2007, the remaining     minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled     $38.2 million, consisting of the following subsequent     extensions:                               January 1, 2008  December 31, 2008            $       30,525              January 1, 2009  March 31, 2009                7,725                                    Total            $       38,250                                   Contingencies:  The Company believes it     maintains insurance coverage adequate for its current needs. The     Companys operations are subject to environmental laws and     regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of     pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for     the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous     wastes. The Company reviews the effects of such laws and     regulations on its operations and modifies its operations as     appropriate. The Company believes it is in substantial     compliance with all applicable environmental laws and     regulations.         Barr Laboratories, Inc., a generic drug manufacturer located in     Pomona, New York, filed an ANDA for the treatment of cutaneous     manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, in the     manner described in our label and seeking permission from the     FDA to market a generic version of 50mg, 100mg and 200mg     THALOMID®.     Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic     manufacturer may file an ANDA with a certification (a     Paragraph IV certification) challenging the     validity or infringement of a patent listed in the FDAs     Orange Book four years after the pioneer company obtains     approval of its New Drug Application, or an NDA. On or after     December 5, 2006, Barr mailed notices of Paragraph IV     certifications alleging that the following patents listed for     THALOMID®     in the Orange Book are invalid, unenforceable,     and/or not     infringed: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,045,501 (the 501     patent), 6,315,720 (the 720 patent),     6,561,976 (the 976 patent), 6,561,977     (the 977 patent), 6,755,784 (the     784 patent), 6,869,399 (the 399     patent), 6,908,432 (the 432 patent), and     7,141,018 (the 018 patent). The 501,     976, and 432 patents do not expire until     August 28, 2018, while the remaining patents do not expire     until October 23, 2020. On January 18, 2007, the     Company filed an infringement action in the United States     District Court of New Jersey against Barr. By bringing suit, the     Company is entitled up to a maximum     30-month     stay, from the date of Celgenes receipt of a     Paragraph IV certification, against the FDAs approval     of a generic applicants application to market a generic     version of     THALOMID®.     In June 2007, United States Patent No. 7,230,012, or     012 patent, was issued to the Company claiming     formulations of thalidomide and was then timely listed in the     Orange        F-34    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         Book. Barr sent to the Company a supplemental Paragraph IV     certification against the 012 patent and alleged that the     claims of the 012 patent, directed to formulations which     encompass     THALOMID®,     were invalid. On August 23, 2007, the Company filed an     infringement action in the United States District Court of New     Jersey with respect to the 012 patent. On or after     October 4, 2007, Barr filed a second supplemental notice of     Paragraph IV certifications relating to the 150 mg     dosage strength of     THALOMID®     alleging that the 501 patent, 720 patent, 976     patent, 977 patent, 784 patent, 399 patent,     432 patent and the 018 patent are invalid,     unenforceable,     and/or not     infringed. On November 14, 2007, the Company filed an     infringement action in the United States District Court of New     Jersey against Barr. All three actions have subsequent been     consolidated. The Company intends to enforce its patent rights.     If the ANDA is approved by the FDA, and Barr is successful in     challenging the Companys patents listed in the Orange Book     for     THALOMID®,     Barr would be permitted to sell a generic thalidomide product.         On August 19, 2004, the Company, together with its     exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the     United States District Court of New Jersey against Teva     Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., in response to notices of     Paragraph IV certifications made by Teva in connection with     the filing of an ANDA for     FOCALIN®.     The notification letters from Teva contend that United States     Patent Nos. 5,908,850, or 850 patent, and 6,355,656, or     656 patent, are invalid. After the suit was filed,     Novartis listed another patent, United States Patent     No. 6,528,530, or 530 patent, in the Orange Book in     association with the     FOCALIN®     NDA. The original 2004 action asserted infringement of the     850 patent. Teva amended its answer during discovery to     contend that the 850 patent was not infringed by the     filing of its ANDA, and that the 850 patent is not     enforceable due to an allegation of inequitable conduct. Fact     discovery in the original 2004 action expired on     February 28, 2006. At about the time of the filing of the     850 patent infringement action, reexamination proceedings     for the 656 patent were initiated in the United States     Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO. On     September 28, 2006, the U.S. PTO issued a Notice of     Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate, and on     March 27, 2007, the Reexamination Certificate for the     656 patent issued. On December 21, 2006, Celgene and     Novartis filed an action in the United States District Court of     New Jersey against Teva for infringement of the 656     patent. Teva filed an amended answer and counterclaim on     March 23, 2007. The amended counterclaim seeks a     declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and     unenforceability. The statutory     30-month     stay of FDA approval of Tevas ANDA expired on     January 9, 2007, and Teva proceeded to market with a     generic version of     FOCALIN®.     Novartis sales of     FOCALIN®     have been significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic     FOCALIN®     product, consequently reducing the Companys revenue from     royalties associated with these sales. A claim has been made for     damages resulting from Tevas sales and for a permanent     injunction prohibiting future sales by Teva. The parties     currently are engaged in fact discovery with respect to the     656 patent and other issues related to Tevas product     launch. No trial date has been set. The 530 patent is not     part of this patent infringement action against Teva.         On September 14, 2007, the Company, together with its     exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the     United States District Court for the District of New Jersey     against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. in response to a notice     of a Paragraph IV certification made by Teva in connection     with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN     XR®.     The notification letter from Teva contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,908,850 and 6,528,530 are invalid,     unenforceable, and not infringed by the proposed Teva products,     and it contends that United States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and     6,635,284 are invalid and not infringed by the proposed Teva     products. Celgene and Novartis asserted each of these patents     and additionally asserted United States Patent     No. 6,355,656 in their complaint against Teva. Teva filed     an answer and counterclaim on November 5, 2007. The     counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity,     noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect to the     patents-in-suit.     No trial date has been set. If the Company is unsuccessful in     proving infringement or defending its patents, Novartis     sales of FOCALIN     XR®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic FOCALIN     XR®     product, consequently reducing the Companys revenue from     royalties associated with these sales.        F-35    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         On October 5, 2007, the Company, together with its     exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the     United States District Court for the District of New Jersey     against IntelliPharmaCeutics Corp. (IPC) in response     to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by IPC in     connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN     XR®.     The notification letter from IPC contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are not     infringed by the proposed IPC products. The notification letter     also contends that claims in United States Patent Nos.     5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are     invalid, and that claims in United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850,     6,355,656 and 6,528,530 are unenforceable. In their complaint     against IPC, Celgene and Novartis asserted United States Patent     Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284.     IPC filed an answer and counterclaim on November 20, 2007.     The counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent     invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect     to Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, and 6,528,530, and it seeks     a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and noninfringement     with respect to Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. No pretrial     or trial dates have been set. If the Company is unsuccessful in     proving infringement or defending its patents, Novartis     sales of FOCALIN     XR®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic FOCALIN     XR®     product, consequently reducing the Companys revenue from     royalties associated with these sales.         On November 8, 2007, the Company, together with its     exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the     United States District Court for the District of New Jersey     against Actavis South Atlantic LLC and Abrika Pharmaceuticals,     Inc. (collectively, Abrika) in response to a notice     of a Paragraph IV certification made by Abrika in     connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN     XR®.     The notification letter from Abrika contends that claims in     United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 5,837,284, and     6,635,284 are not infringed by the proposed Abrika products, and     it contends that claims in United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850,     6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid. In     their complaint against Abrika, Celgene and Novartis asserted     United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530,     5,837,284, and 6,635,284. No pretrial or trial dates have been     set. If the Company is unsuccessful in proving infringement or     defending its patents, Novartis sales of FOCALIN     XR®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic FOCALIN     XR®     product, consequently reducing the Companys revenue from     royalties associated with these sales.         On November 16, 2007, the Company, together with its     exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the     United States District Court for the District of New Jersey     against Barr Laboratories, Inc. and Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc.     in response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification     made by Barr in connection with the filing of an ANDA for     FOCALIN     XR®.     The notification letter from Barr contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 5,837,284, and     6,635,284 are not infringed by the proposed Barr products, and     it contends that claims in United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850,     6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid. In     their complaint against Barr, Celgene and Novartis asserted     United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530,     5,837,284, and 6,635,284.

On December 4, 2006, the Company, together with its     exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the     United States District Court for the District of New Jersey     against Abrika Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Abrika Pharmaceuticals,     LLP, in response to a notice of a Paragraph IV     certification made by Abrika in connection with the filing of an     ANDA for RITALIN     LA®,     20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg generic products. The     notification letter from Abrika contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid and are     not infringed by the proposed Abrika products. In their     complaint against Abrika, Celgene and Novartis asserted United     States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. Abrika filed an     answer and counterclaim in the New Jersey court on June 1,     2007. The counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent     invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect     to the     patents-in-suit.     On September 26, 2007, Abrika sent        F-36    Table of Contents     Celgene     Corporation and Subsidiaries      Notes to     Consolidated Financial     Statements  (Continued)         a Paragraph IV certification to Celgene and Novartis in     connection with the filing of an ANDA supplement with respect to     Abrikas proposed generic 10 mg RITALIN     LA®     product. Celgene and Novartis filed an amended complaint against     Abrika on November 5, 2007 that includes infringement     allegations directed to Abrikas proposed generic     10 mg RITALIN     LA®     product.

The counterclaim seeks a     declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and     unenforceability with respect to the     patents-in-suit.     No trial date has been set. The parties are currently engaged in     fact discovery with a current fact discovery deadline of     February 22, 2008. If the Company is unsuccessful in     proving infringement or defending its patents, Novartis     sales of RITALIN     LA®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic RITALIN     LA®     product, consequently reducing the Companys revenue from     royalties associated with these sales.         On October 4, 2007, the Company, together with its     exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the     United States District Court for the District of New Jersey     against KV Pharmaceutical Company in response to a notice of a     Paragraph IV certification made by KV in connection with     the filing of an ANDA for RITALIN     LA®.

No pretrial or trial dates have been set. If the Company is     unsuccessful in proving infringement or defending our patents,     Novartis sales of RITALIN     LA®     could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic RITALIN     LA®     product, consequently reducing the Companys revenue from     royalties associated with these sales.         On October 31, 2007, the Company, together with its     exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the     United States District Court for the District of New Jersey     against Barr Laboratories, Inc. and Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc.     in response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification     made by Barr in connection with the filing of an ANDA for     RITALIN     LA®.     The notification letter from Barr contends that claims in United     States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid and not     infringed by the proposed Barr products. In their complaint     against Barr, Celgene and Novartis asserted United States Patent     Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284.

On October 29, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against Centocor,     Inc. to prevent Centocors use of the term     I.M.I.D.s in connection with Centocors     products, which use, we believe, is likely to cause confusion     with our     IMiDs®     registered trademark for compounds (including     REVLIMID®)     developed or being developed by us to treat cancer and     inflammatory diseases. In 2007, we settled the case and Centocor     agreed to stop using the term I.M.I.D.s.           (18)     Geographic     and Product Information       Operations by Geographic Area:  Revenues within     the U.S. primarily consist of sales of     REVLIMID®,     THALOMID®,     ALKERAN®     and     FOCALINtm.
