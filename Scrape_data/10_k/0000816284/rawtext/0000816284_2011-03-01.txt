BUSINESS           Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively     we, our or us) is a global     integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the     discovery, development and commercialization of innovative     therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory     related diseases. We are dedicated to innovative research and     development which is designed to bring new therapies to market     and are involved in research in several scientific areas that     may deliver proprietary next-generation therapies, targeting     areas such as immunomodulation and intracellular signaling     pathways in hematology, oncology and immune-inflammatory     diseases. The products we develop are designed to treat     life-threatening diseases or chronic debilitating conditions.     Building on our growing knowledge of the biology underlying     hematological and solid tumor cancers as well as in     immune-inflammatory diseases, we are investing in a range of     innovative therapeutic programs that are investigating ways to     treat and manage chronic diseases by targeting the disease     source through multiple mechanisms of action.         Our primary commercial stage products include     REVLIMID®,      VIDAZA®,      THALOMID®      (inclusive of Thalidomide     Celgene®      and Thalidomide     Pharmion®),      ABRAXANE®,      which was obtained in the October 2010 acquisition of Abraxis     BioScience, Inc., or Abraxis, and     ISTODAX®,      which was obtained in the January 2010 acquisition of Gloucester     Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Gloucester. Additional sources of     revenue include sales of     FOCALIN®      exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, a licensing     agreement with Novartis, which entitles us to royalties on     FOCALIN     XR®      and the entire     RITALIN®      family of drugs, residual royalty payments from GlaxoSmithKline,     or GSK, based upon GSKs     ALKERAN®      revenues through the end of March 2011, sale of services through     our Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary and other miscellaneous     licensing agreements.         In 1986, we were spun off from Celanese Corporation and, in July     1987, completed an initial public offering. Our initial     operations focused on the research and development of chemical     and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical     industries. We subsequently completed the following strategic     acquisitions that strengthened our research and manufacturing     capabilities in addition to enhancing our commercialized     products:                         In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,     currently Signal Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a privately held     biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and     development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease.                    In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., a privately     held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood     banking business, developing technologies for the recovery of     stem cells from human placental tissues following the completion     of full-term, successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis d/b/a     Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, now operates as our     wholly owned subsidiary engaged in the research, recovery,     culture-expansion, preservation, development and distribution of     placental cells, including stem and progenitor cells, as     therapeutic agents.                    In March 2008, we acquired Pharmion Corporation, or Pharmion, a     global biopharmaceutical company that acquired, developed and     commercialized innovative products for the treatment of     hematology and oncology patients. Pharmion was acquired to     enhance our portfolio of therapies for patients with     life-threatening illnesses worldwide with the addition of     Pharmions marketed products, and several products in     development for the treatment of hematological and solid tumor     cancers. By combining this new product portfolio with our     existing operational and financial capabilities, we enlarged our     global market share through increased product offerings and     expanded clinical, regulatory and commercial capabilities.                    In January 2010, we acquired Gloucester, a privately held     pharmaceutical company which developed new therapies that     address unmet medical needs in the treatment of hematological     cancers, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL,     peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, and other hematological     malignancies. Gloucester was acquired to advance our leadership     position in the development of disease-altering therapies     through innovative approaches for patients with rare and     debilitating blood cancers.                    In October 2010, we acquired Abraxis, a fully integrated global     biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery, development     and delivery of next-generation therapeutics and core     technologies that offer patients treatments for cancer and other     critical illnesses. The acquisition of Abraxis accelerates our     strategy            1    Table of Contents                   to become a global leader in oncology and adds     ABRAXANE®,      which is based on Abraxis proprietary tumor-targeting     platform known as     nab®      technology, to our existing portfolio of leading cancer products.           For the year ended December 31, 2010, we reported revenue     of $3.626 billion, net income of $880.5 million and     diluted earnings per share of $1.88. Revenue increased by     $935.9 million in 2010 compared to the year ended     December 31, 2009 primarily due to our continuing expansion     into international markets, growth of     REVLIMID®      and     VIDAZA®      in both U.S. and international markets and the inclusion of     sales of     ABRAXANE®      and     ISTODAX®      subsequent to the acquisition dates of Abraxis and Gloucester,     respectively. Net income and earnings per share for 2010 reflect     the earnings contributions from a higher sales level, partly     offset by increased spending for new product launches, research     and development, expansion of our international operations and     additional costs related to the acquisitions of Gloucester and     Abraxis.         Our future growth and operating results will depend on the     continued acceptance of our marketed products, future regulatory     approvals and successful commercialization of new products and     new product indications, depth of our product pipeline,     competition with our marketed products and challenges to our     intellectual property.

THALOMID®      is distributed in the United States under our System     for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety, or     S.T.E.P.S.®,      program which we developed and is a proprietary comprehensive     education and risk-management distribution program with the     objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution     and use of     THALOMID®.      Internationally,     THALOMID®      is also distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution     programs tailored to meet local competent authorities     specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate     distribution and use of     THALOMID®.      These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the     country and the design of the risk-management program, the     product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.     ABRAXANE®:  ABRAXANE®      for injectable suspension (paclitaxel protein-bound particles     for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound) was approved by the     U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in January 2005,     based on a 505(b)(2) submission, for the treatment of metastatic     breast cancer and, as of December 2010, was approved for     marketing in 42 countries.     ABRAXANE®      represents the first in a new class of protein-bound drug     particles that takes advantage of albumin, a natural carrier of     water insoluble molecules found in humans.     ISTODAX®      (romidespin):  is a histone deacetylase, or HDAC,     inhibitor, which was approved by the FDA for the treatment of     CTCL in patients who have received at least one prior systemic     therapy. We are currently pursuing an additional indication in     PTCL in the United States and plan to file for an approval in     both PTCL and CTCL in the European Union, or E.U.     FOCALIN®      and     RITALIN®:  We      licensed the worldwide rights (excluding Canada) to     FOCALIN®      and FOCALIN     XR®      to Novartis for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity     disorder, or ADHD, and retained the rights to these products for     the treatment of oncology-related disorders. We sell     FOCALIN®      exclusively to Novartis and receive royalties on all of     Novartis sales of FOCALIN     XR®.      FOCALIN®      is formulated with the active d-isomer of methylphenidate and     contains only the more active isomer responsible for the     effective management of the symptoms of ADHD. We also licensed     the rights to the     RITALIN®      family of ADHD-related products to Novartis and receive     royalties on their sales.

ALKERAN®      was approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple     myeloma and of carcinoma of the ovary. Subsequent to the     conclusion date of the     ALKERAN®      license, and ending in March 2011, we will continue to receive     residual payments from GSK based upon its     ALKERAN®      revenues.         3    Table of Contents        Current evaluations of our commercial stage products and their     targeted disease indications are outlined in the following table:                           Product       Disease Indication       Status                REVLIMID            Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma           Phase III complete, submitted EU regulatory filing, US     regulatory filing pending                 NHL           Phase III trials ongoing                 CLL           Phase III trials ongoing                 Prostate cancer           Phase III trial ongoing                 MDS           Phase III trial ongoing                                ABRAXANE            Non-small cell lung cancer           Phase III trial completed accrual, filing pending                 Pancreatic cancer           Phase III trial ongoing                 Melanoma           Phase III trial ongoing                 Bladder cancer           Phase II trail ongoing                 Ovarian cancer           Phase II trail ongoing                                ISTODAX            CTCL           Approved in US, filing in EU pending                 PTCL           Filed for approval in US, filing in EU pending                                VIDAZA            AML           Phase III trial enrolling         PRECLINICAL     AND CLINICAL  STAGE PIPELINE         Our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline of new drug     candidates and cell therapies, is highlighted by multiple     classes of small molecule, orally administered therapeutic     agents designed to selectively regulate disease-associated genes     and proteins. The product candidates in our pipeline are at     various stages of preclinical and clinical development.     Successful results in preclinical or Phase I/II clinical studies     may not be an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or     effectiveness of a drug or product candidate.                     Phase I Clinical Trials           Phase I human clinical trials begin when regulatory agencies     allow a request to initiate clinical investigations of a new     drug or product candidate to become effective and usually     involve between 20 to 80 healthy volunteers or patients. The     tests study a drugs safety profile, and may include     preliminary determination of a drug or product candidates     safe dosage range. The Phase I clinical studies also determine     how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by     the body, and therefore potentially the duration of its action.                     Phase II Clinical Trials           Phase II clinical trials are conducted on a limited number     of patients with the targeted disease. An initial evaluation of     the drugs effectiveness on patients is performed and     additional information on the drugs safety and dosage     range is obtained.                     Phase III Clinical Trials           Phase III clinical trials typically include controlled     multi-center trials and involve a larger target patient     population to ensure that study results are statistically     significant. During Phase III clinical trials, physicians     monitor patients to determine efficacy and to gather further     information on safety.     Pomalidomide:  Pomalidomide is an     IMiD®      drug, a proprietary, novel, small molecule that is orally     available and modulates the immune system and other biologically     important targets. Pomalidomide is being evaluated in a     Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of     myelofibrosis. A Phase III clinical trial is being planned     to evaluate pomalidomide as a treatment for patients with     relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.         4    Table of Contents        Additional     IMiDs®      compounds are in preclinical development. Our     IMiDs®      compounds are covered by an extensive and comprehensive     intellectual property estate of U.S. and foreign-issued     patents and pending patent applications including     composition-of-matter,     use and other patents and patent applications.     ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS:  Our oral     pluripotent immunomodulators are members of a proprietary     pipeline of novel small molecules with anti-inflammatory     activities that impede the production of multiple     proinflammatory mediators by inhibiting PDE-4, also causing     reductions in TNF-α as well as interleukin-8, or IL-8,     IL-17 and IL-23, interferon-gamma, leukotrienes and nitric oxide     synthase and it up regulates IL-10. Apremilast is our lead     investigational drug in this class of anti-inflammatory     compounds and is currently being evaluated as a potential     therapy for patients with     moderate-to-severe     psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis as well as rheumatoid     arthritis in six Phase III clinical trials. We are also     exploring the use of apremilast in additional rheumatic,     dermatologic and inflammatory diseases to determine its     potential. In addition, we are investigating our next generation     oral pluripotent immunomodulator, CC-11050, which has completed     Phase I trials, towards evaluating its safety and efficacy in a     number of inflammatory conditions and are moving forward with     its development.     KINASE INHIBITORS:  We have generated     valuable intellectual property in the identification of multiple     kinases that regulate pathways critical in inflammation and     oncology. Our oral kinase inhibitor platform includes inhibitors     of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or JNK, mTOR kinase, spleen     tyrosine kinase, or Syk,     c-fms     tyrosine kinase, or     c-FMS, and     DNA-dependent protein kinase, or DNAPK. Our oral Syk,     c-FMS and     DNAPK kinase inhibitors are being investigated in pre-clinical     studies and targeting human trials in 2012. Our oral JNK     inhibitor, CC-401, has successfully completed a Phase I trial in     healthy volunteers and in AML patients to determine safety and     tolerability. No further studies with CC-401 are planned at this     time as we intend to advance our new second generation JNK     inhibitors, specifically CC-930, which recently completed a     Phase Ib multiple dose study. We are also planning to     investigate CC-930 in fibrotic conditions assuming safety and     tolerability continue to be acceptable.     SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER:  Amrubicin is a     third-generation fully synthetic anthracycline molecule with     potent topoisomerase II inhibition and is currently being     studied as a single agent and in combination with anti-cancer     therapies for solid tumors. In 2008, the FDA granted amrubicin     orphan drug designation for the treatment of small cell lung     cancer and fast track product designation for the treatment of     small cell lung cancer after first-line chemotherapy. A drug     designated as a fast track product is intended for the treatment     of a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the     potential to provide a therapy where none exists or provide a     therapy which may offer a significant improvement in safety     and/or     effectiveness over existing therapy.     ABI COMPOUNDS:  ABI compounds are     targeted nanoparticle, albumin-bound compounds being     investigated for potential treatment of solid tumor cancers.     These compounds include: ABI-008     (nab®      -docetaxel), which is in a Phase II trial for hormone     refractory prostate cancer; ABI-009     (nab®      -rapamycin), which is an mTOR inhibitor currently in a Phase I     trial in patients with solid tumors; ABI-010     (nab®      -17AAG), which is an Hsp90 inhibitor that completed pre-clinical     analysis and the initial new drug application, or IND, was     approved by the FDA in May 2008; and ABI-011     (nab®      -thiocolchicine dimer), which is a novel thiocolchicine with     dual mechanisms of action showing both microtubule     destabilization and the disruption of topoisomerase-1 activity.     An IND was filed in the third quarter of 2009.     COROXANEtm (nanometer-sized paclitaxel,     ABRAXANE®,      under the trade name     COROXANEtm):  COROXANEtm      is currently closing its Phase II clinical studies for     coronary restenosis as well as peripheral artery (superficial     femoral artery) restenosis. The SNAPIST series of studies     examines the use of     COROXANEtm      in the treatment of coronary artery restenosis, including the     use of     COROXANEtm      in patients receiving bare metal stents.     COROXANEtm,      administered with bare metal stents may address the issue of     incomplete re-endothelialization and acute thrombosis associated     with drug-eluting stents.     COROXANEtm      administered following balloon angioplasty in the superficial     femoral artery may help reduce the incidence of restenosis in     these patients. We currently intend to seek a strategic partner     for the further development and marketing of     COROXANEtm.      CELLULAR THERAPIES:  At CCT, we are     researching stem cells derived from the human placenta as well     as from the umbilical cord. CCT is our     state-of-the-art     research and development division dedicated to fulfilling the          5    Table of Contents        promise of cellular technologies by developing cutting-edge     products and therapies to significantly benefit patients. Our     goal is to develop proprietary cell therapy products for the     treatment of unmet medical needs.         Stem cell based therapies offer the potential to provide     disease-modifying outcomes for serious diseases which lack     adequate therapy. We have developed proprietary technology for     collecting, processing and storing placental stem cells with     potentially broad therapeutic applications in cancer,     auto-immune diseases including Crohns disease and multiple     sclerosis, neurological disorders including stroke and     amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, graft-versus-host     disease, or GVHD, and other     immunological / anti-inflammatory, rheumatologic and     bone disorders. We have initiated Phase II studies for our     human placenta derived cell product, PDA-001, to evaluate     PDA-001 as a potential treatment for patients with     moderate-to-severe     Crohns disease refractory to oral corticosteroids and     immune suppressants, patients with multiple sclerosis, and     patients with stroke or rheumatoid arthritis.         We also maintain an IND with the FDA for a trial with human     umbilical cord blood in sickle cell anemia and an IND for human     placental-derived stem cells, or HPDSC, to support a study to     assess the safety of its transplantation with umbilical cord     blood stem cells, obtained from fully or partially matched     related donors in subjects with certain malignant hematological     diseases and non-malignant disorders. We are continuing     additional preclinical and clinical research to define further     the potential of placental-derived stem cells and to     characterize other placental-derived products.     SOTATERCEPT (ACE-011):  We have a     collaboration with Acceleron Pharma, or Acceleron, to develop     sotatercept. Sotatercept acts as a decoy receptor for members of     the growth and differentiation factor, or GDF, family of ligands     that bind the ACTIIRB receptor, with highest affinity for     Activin A and B. Two Phase I clinical studies have been     completed (A011-01 and A011-02); and two Phase II studies     (A011-04 and A011-08) are closed and awaiting completion of the     clinical study report. Three additional Phase II clinical     studies have been initiated and are currently ongoing     (A011-REN-001 in end stage renal anemia, A011-NSCL-001 for     chemotherapy-induced anemia in non-small cell lung cancer, or     NSCLC, patients and A011-ST-001 to evaluate effects on red blood     cell mass and plasma volume).         6    Table of Contents    CELGENE     LEADING PRODUCT CANDIDATES         The development of our leading new drug candidates and their     targeted disease indications are outlined in the following table:                           Product       Disease Indication       Status                IMiDs®      Compounds:                           Pomalidomide (CC-4047)            Myelofibrosis           Phase III trial ongoing                 Multiple myeloma           Phase II trial ongoing, pivotal trial planned          Oral Anti-Inflammatory:                           Apremilast (CC-10004)            Psoriasis           Phase III trials ongoing                 Psoriatic arthritis           Phase III trials ongoing                 Rheumatoid arthritis           Phase II trial enrolling          CC-11050            Cutaneous lupus           Phase II trial ongoing                                Kinase Inhibitors:                           JNK CC-930            Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis           Phase II trial ongoing                                Small Cell Lung Cancer:                           Amrubicin            Small cell lung cancer           Phase III trial completed                                Nab®-docetaxel      (ABI-008)            Solid tumors           Phase I completed in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).

For many of our products, in     addition to compound patents we hold other patents on     manufacturing processes, formulations, or uses that may extend     exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent.         7    Table of Contents    KEY     PRODUCTS: TABLE OF EXCLUSIVITIES         The following table shows the estimated expiration dates in the     United States and in Europe of the     last-to-expire     period of exclusivity (regulatory or patent) related to the     following approved drugs:                                         U.S.           Europe            REVLIMID®      brand drug (U.S. drug substance patent) (European Patent Office, or EPO     use/drug product patent)                2026               2023      THALOMID®      brand drug (use and/or drug product patents)                2023               2019      VIDAZA®      brand drug (U.S. and EMA regulatory exclusivities only)                2011               2018      ABRAXANE®      brand drug (U.S. use/drug product patent) (EMA regulatory exclusivity)                2024               2018      ISTODAX®      brand drug      (U.S. drug substance patents) (EMA regulatory exclusivity upon     approval)                2021               (10 years regulatory     exclusivity upon approval)      FOCALIN®      brand drug (U.S. use patents)                2015               N/A      FOCALIN     XR®      brand drug (U.S. use patents) (EPO drug product patent)                2015               2018      RITALIN     LA®      brand drug (U.S. use patents) (EPO drug product patent)                2015               2018             In the United States, the patents covering the     REVLIMID®      brand drug include thirteen (13) patents that are listed in     the Orange Book, all of which are assigned to us. The     last-to-expire     patent (2026), U.S. Patent No. 7,465,800, covers     certain polymorphic forms of the pharmaceutically active     ingredient of     REVLIMID®      brand drug.         REVLIMID®      brand drug is also covered in foreign countries by patents and     patent applications that are equivalent to those listed in the     U.S. Orange Book. For example, patents related to the     active pharmaceutical ingredient, uses and pharmaceutical     compositions are granted in Europe. The patents are currently     scheduled to expire in 2017 or 2018, except that patents granted     in certain European countries such as, for example, Spain,     France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom will not expire     until 2022 due to the supplementary protection certificates, or     SPCs, granted in these countries. In addition, patents in Europe     that relate to uses of and products comprising lenalidomide     relative to multiple myeloma will not expire until 2023.         The patents covering     THALOMID®      brand drug in the United States include thirteen     (13) patents that are listed in the Orange Book. The     last-to-expire     patent (2023), U.S. Patent No. 7,230,012, that is     assigned to us, covers marketed     THALOMID®      formulations.         In foreign countries,     THALOMID®      brand drug is also covered by patents and patent applications     that are equivalent to those listed in the U.S. Orange     Book. Patents related to the approved uses of thalidomide are     granted in Europe. The patents are currently scheduled to expire     in 2014 or 2017, except that patents granted in certain European     countries, such as for example, Spain, France and Italy, will     not expire until 2019 due to the SPCs granted in these countries.         Exclusivity with respect to the currently approved formulation     for     VIDAZA®      brand drug stems from regulatory mechanisms. In the United     States, orphan drug exclusivity with respect to     VIDAZA®      brand drug expires in May 2011. In Europe, new drug and orphan     exclusivities relative to     VIDAZA®      brand drug expire in December 2018.         The patents covering     ABRAXANE®      brand drug in the United States include eight (8) patents     that are listed in the Orange Book. The     last-to-expire     patent (2024), U.S. Patent No. 7,820,788, covers     marketed     ABRAXANE®      formulations. In Europe, new drug exclusivity relative to     ABRAXANE®      brand drug expires in 2018. We have applied for Supplementary     Protection Certificates in Europe relative to EP 0 961 612 B1     that, if granted, would          8    Table of Contents        extend exclusivity for     ABRAXANE®      brand drug to 2022. EP 0 961 612 B1 presently is under     opposition at the European Patent Office by Teva Pharmaceutical     Industries Ltd.         Our acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals Inc. included the     acquisition of certain intellectual properties relative to     ISTODAX®      brand drug. United States Patent No. 4,977,138 is presently     estimated to expire on July 6, 2011. The remaining two     patents, related to alternate forms of the active pharmaceutical     ingredient of     ISTODAX®      brand drug, expire on the same date: August 22, 2021.         In the United States, the patents covering     FOCALIN®      brand drug include three (3) patents that are listed in the     Orange Book. All of these patents are assigned to us. These     patents all expire on the same date: December 4, 2015.         In the United States, the patents covering FOCALIN     XR®      brand drug comprise six (6) patents that are listed in the     Orange Book. All of these six (6) patents are assigned to     us. These patents all expire on the same date: December 4,     2015. A relevant European patent, owned by us, expires on     June 9, 2018.         In the United States, the patents covering RITALIN     LA®      brand drug comprise three (3) patents that are listed in     the Orange Book. All of these three (3) patents are     assigned to us. These patents all expire on the same date:     December 4, 2015. A relevant European patent, owned by us,     expires on June 9, 2018.         In terms of our United States patents for     FOCALIN®,      FOCALIN     XR®      and RITALIN     LA®      brand drugs, the previously disclosed litigations with generic     drug companies (i.e. TEVA Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,     IntelliPharmaCeutics Corp., Actavis South Atlantic LLC, Abrika     Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Barr Pharmaceutical, Inc. and KV     Pharmaceutical Company), see annual report on     Form 10-K     filed on February 18, 2010, were resolved pursuant to     confidential settlements which do allow for the entrance of     their respective generic products in the United States prior to     the 2015 patent expirations, should their respective ANDA     applications have FDA approval.         As noted above, patent protection is very important to us and     our business and, therefore, we have applied for and received     SPCs in Europe relative to certain in-licensed CMCC thalidomide     patents. These SPCs, reflected in the chart above, extend the     terms of these patents relative to certain uses of thalidomide     to 2019. In addition, also as reflected in the chart above, we     have applied for and received SPCs to 2022 in Europe relative to     lenalidomide. In the United States, we have been granted a     patent term extension of our     REVLIMID®      composition of matter patent to 2019. By way of further example,     in the United States, and as reflected in the chart above, we     have been granted patent term adjustment with respect to a     REVLIMID®      polymorph patent; this patent is presently scheduled to expire     in 2026.         Patent term extensions have been granted in other markets as     well including Australia and Korea relative to certain of our     patents claiming lenalidomide. Patent term extension     applications relative to lenalidomide also are pending in Japan.     In addition, we have actively considered and may pursue     alternate exclusivity strategies, mostly related to     international treaties, in a variety of countries throughout     Latin America.         Trade secret strategies also are integral to our success. There     exist certain trade secrets related to many of our key products,     including     ABRAXANE®      brand drug.         Our brand names, logos and trademarks are also important to us     and in the aggregate important to our success. We maintain both     registered and common law trademarks. Common law trademark     protection typically continues where and for as long as the mark     is used. Registered trademarks continue in each country for as     long as the trademark is registered,         In total, we own or have exclusively licensed over 280 issued     U.S. patents. In addition, approximately 310 additional     pending patent applications are owned by or exclusively licensed     to us. We have a policy to seek worldwide patent protection for     our inventions and have foreign patent rights corresponding to     most of our U.S. patents.         In August 2001, we entered into an agreement, termed the     New Thalidomide Agreement, with EntreMed, Inc., or     EntreMed, Childrens Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC,     and Bioventure Investments kft relating to patents and patent     applications owned by CMCC, which agreement superceded several     agreements already in place between CMCC, EntreMed and us.     Pursuant to the New Thalidomide Agreement, CMCC directly granted     to us an exclusive worldwide license under the relevant patents     and patent applications relating to thalidomide. Several     U.S. and European patents have been issued to CMCC in this     patent family and certain of these patents expire in 2013 and     2014. We have applied for and received Supplementary Protection     Certificates, or SPCs, in Europe          9    Table of Contents        relative to certain of these issued CMCC thalidomide patents.     These SPCs extend the terms of these patents relative to uses of     thalidomide to 2019. Corresponding foreign patent applications     and additional U.S. patent applications are still pending.         In addition to the New Thalidomide Agreement, we entered into an     agreement, entitled the New Analog Agreement, with     CMCC and EntreMed in December 2002, pursuant to which we have     been granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain CMCC     patents and patent applications relating to thalidomide analogs.     Under the New Analog Agreement, CMCC exclusively licensed to us     these patents and patent applications, which relate to analogs,     metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products of thalidomide,     and stereoisomers thereof. Under the New Analog Agreement, we     are obligated to comply with certain milestones and other     obligations, including those relating to     REVLIMID®      brand drug sales. The New Analog Agreement grants us control     over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed thalidomide     analog patent rights.         Our research leads us to seek patent protection for molecular     targets and drug discovery technologies, as well as therapeutic     and diagnostic products and processes. More specifically,     proprietary technology has been developed for use in molecular     target discovery, the identification of regulatory pathways in     cells, assay design and the discovery and development of     pharmaceutical product candidates. An increasing percentage of     our recent patent applications have been related to potential     product candidates or compounds. As of December 2010, included     in those inventions described above, we owned, in whole or in     part, over 100 issued U.S. patents and have filed over 110     U.S. pending patent applications, including pending     provisional applications, some of which are related to sponsored     or collaborative research relationships.         CCT, our cellular therapeutics subsidiary, seeks patent     protection for the collection, processing, composition,     formulation and uses of mammalian placental and umbilical cord     tissue and placental and umbilical cord stem cells, as well as     cells and biomaterials derived from the placenta. As of December     2010, CCT owned, in whole or in part, 10 U.S. patents,     including claims to novel cells and cellular compositions. In     addition, CCT has approximately 60 U.S. patent     applications, including pending provisional applications.         Our patents are regularly subject to challenge by generic drug     companies and manufacturers. See Part I, Item 3,     Legal Proceedings. We rely on several different     types of patents to protect our products, including, without     limitation, compound, polymorph, formulation and method of use     patents. We do not know whether any of these patents will be     circumvented, invalidated or found unenforceable as a result of     challenge by generic companies or manufacturers. For a more     detailed discussion of risks related to our patent portfolio see     Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.     GOVERNMENTAL     REGULATION/EXCLUSIVITIES AFFORDED BY REGULATORY     AUTHORITIES         Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and     other countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and     marketing of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and     development activities. Most, if not all, of our therapeutic     products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies     prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic     products are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and     clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by     the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the     United States, various federal and, in some cases, state     statutes and regulations also govern or impact upon the     manufacturing, testing for safety and effectiveness, labeling,     storage, record-keeping and marketing of such products. The     lengthy process of seeking required approvals, and the     continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and     regulations, requires the expenditure of substantial resources.     Regulatory approval, if and when obtained, may be limited in     scope which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which     a product may be marketed. Further, approved drugs, as well as     their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing review and discovery     of previously unknown problems with such products or the     manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their     production may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale     or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure by     us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or     licensees to obtain or maintain, or any delay in obtaining,     regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our     products and our ability to receive product revenue, license     revenue or profit sharing payments.         The activities required before a product may be marketed in the     United States begin with preclinical testing not involving human     subjects. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a     product candidates chemistry and its          10    Table of Contents        biological activities and the conduct of animal studies to     assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate     and its formulations. The results of these studies must be     submitted to the FDA as part of an IND which must be reviewed by     the FDA primarily for safety considerations before proposed     clinical trials in humans can begin.         Typically, clinical trials involve a three-phase process as     previously described. In some cases, further studies (Phase     IV) are required as a condition for a new drug application,     or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, approval, to     provide additional information concerning the drug or product.     The FDA requires monitoring of all aspects of clinical trials,     and reports of all adverse events must be made to the agency     before drug approval. After approval, we have ongoing reporting     obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the     drug, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected     adverse events. Additionally, we may have limited control over     studies conducted with our proprietary compounds or biologics if     such studies are performed by others (e.g., cooperative groups).         The results of the preclinical testing and clinical trials are     submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA for evaluation to     determine if the product is sufficiently safe and effective for     approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA     or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional     information or deny the application if it determines that the     application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria.     When an NDA or BLA is approved, the NDA or BLA holder must     a) employ a system for obtaining reports of experience and     side effects associated with the drug and make appropriate     submissions to the FDA and b) timely advise the FDA if any     marketed product fails to adhere to specifications established     by the NDA or BLA internal manufacturing procedures.         Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the     FDA designate a drug intended to treat a rare disease or     condition as an orphan drug. The term     orphan drug can refer to either a drug or biologic.     A rare disease or condition is defined as one which affects less     than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects     more than 200,000 people, but for which the cost of     developing and making available the product is not expected to     be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.     Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated     as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of     that NDA or BLA is entitled to seven years of exclusive     marketing rights in the United States for such drug or product     containing the active ingredient for the same indication unless     the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient     quantities of the drug to meet the needs of persons with the     disease. However, orphan drug status is particular to the     approved indication and does not prevent another company from     seeking approval of other labeled indications. The period of     orphan exclusivity is concurrent with any patent exclusivity     that relates to the drug or biologic. Orphan drugs may also be     eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated     with the drugs development. Possible amendment of the     Orphan Drug Act by the U.S. Congress and possible     reinterpretation by the FDA has been discussed by regulators and     legislators. FDA regulations reflecting certain definitions,     limitations and procedures for orphan drugs initially went into     effect in January 1993 and were amended in certain respects in     1998. Therefore, there is no assurance as to the precise scope     of protection that may be afforded by orphan drug status in the     future or that the current level of exclusivity and tax credits     will remain in effect. Moreover, even if we have an orphan drug     designation for a particular use of a drug, there can be no     assurance that another company also holding orphan drug     designation will not receive approval prior to us for the same     indication. If that were to happen, our applications for that     indication could not be approved until the competing     companys seven-year period of exclusivity expired. Even if     we are the first to obtain approval for the orphan drug     indication, there are certain circumstances under which a     competing product may be approved for the same indication during     our seven-year period of exclusivity. Further, particularly in     the case of large molecule drugs or biologics, a question can be     raised whether the competing product is really the same     drug as that which was approved. In addition, even in     cases in which two products appear to be the same drug, the     agency may approve the second product based on a showing of     clinical superiority compared to the first product. In order to     increase the development and marketing of drugs for rare     disorders, regulatory bodies outside the United States have     enacted regulations similar to the Orphan Drug Act.     REVLIMID®      brand drug has been granted orphan medicinal product designation     by the European Commission, or EC, for treatment of CLL     following the favorable opinion of the European Medicines     Agencys, or EMA, Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.         Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement     that the prospective manufacturers quality control and     manufacturing procedures continually conform with the FDAs     current Good Manufacturing          11    Table of Contents        Practice, or cGMP, regulations (which are regulations     established by the FDA governing the manufacture, processing,     packing, storage and testing of drugs and biologics intended for     human use). In complying with cGMP, manufacturers must devote     extensive time, money and effort in the area of production and     quality control and quality assurance to maintain full technical     compliance. Manufacturing facilities and company records are     subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to ensure compliance.     If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance     with these requirements, regulatory enforcement action may be     taken by the FDA, which may include seeking an injunction     against shipment of products from the facility and recall of     products previously shipped from the facility.         Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and     Cosmetic Act, or the Act, products covered by approved NDAs or     supplemental NDAs may be protected by periods of patent     and/or     non-patent exclusivity. During the exclusivity periods, the FDA     is generally prevented from granting effective approval of an     abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. Further, NDAs submitted under     505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act may not reference     data contained in the NDA for a product protected by an     effective and unexpired exclusivity. ANDAs and 505(b)(2)     applications are generally less burdensome than full NDAs in     that, in lieu of new clinical data, the applications rely in     whole, or in part, upon the safety and efficacy findings of the     referenced approved drug in conjunction with bridging data,     typically bioequivalence data. Upon the expiration of the     applicable exclusivities, through passage of time or successful     legal challenge, the FDA may grant effective approval of an ANDA     for a generic drug, or may accept reference to a previously     protected NDA in a 505(b)(2) application. Depending upon the     scope of the applicable exclusivities, any such approval could     be limited to certain formulations     and/or     indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any outstanding     exclusivities. While the Act provides for ANDA and 505(b)(2)     abbreviated approval pathways for drugs earlier submitted as     NDAs and approved under section 505 of the Act, there are     presently no similar provisions for biologics submitted as BLAs     and approved under the Public Health Service, or PHS, Act. There     is currently no abbreviated application that would permit     approval of a generic or follow-on biologic based on     the FDAs earlier approval of another manufacturers     application under section 351 of the PHS Act.         Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements     can result in enforcement actions such as warning letters,     recalls or adverse publicity issued by the FDA or in legal     actions such as seizures, injunctions, fines based on the     equitable remedy of disgorgement, restitution and criminal     prosecution.         Approval procedures similar to those in the United States must     be undertaken in virtually every other country comprising the     market for our products before any such product can be     commercialized in those countries. The approval procedure and     the time required for approval vary from country to country and     may involve additional testing. There can be no assurance that     approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all. In     addition, regulatory approval of drug and biologics pricing is     required in most countries other than the United States. There     can be no assurance that the resulting pricing of our products     would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us.     COMPETITION         The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are each highly     competitive. We also compete with universities and research     institutions in the development of products and processes, and     in the acquisition of technology from outside sources.         Competition in the pharmaceutical industry, and specifically in     the oncology and immune-inflammatory areas, is particularly     intense. Numerous pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug     companies have extensive anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug     discovery, development and commercial resources. Abbott     Laboratories, Amgen Inc., or Amgen, AstraZeneca PLC., Biogen     Idec Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Eisai Co., Ltd.,     F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., Johnson and Johnson, Merck and     Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis and Takeda     Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Takeda, are among some of the     companies researching and developing new compounds in the     oncology, inflammation and immunology fields. We, along with     other pharmaceutical brand-name makers, face the challenges     brought on by generic drug manufacturers in their pursuit of     obtaining bulk quantities of certain drugs in order for them to     be able to develop similar versions of these products and be     ready to market as soon as permitted.         12    Table of Contents        The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have undergone,     and are expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant     technological change. Consolidation and competition are expected     to intensify as technical advances in each field are achieved     and become more widely known. In order to compete effectively,     we will be required to continually upgrade and expand our     scientific expertise and technology, identify and retain capable     personnel and pursue scientifically feasible and commercially     viable opportunities.         Our competition will be determined in part by the indications     and geographic markets for which our products are developed and     ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. The relative     speed with which we develop new products, complete clinical     trials, obtain regulatory approvals, receive pricing and     reimbursement approvals, finalize agreements with outside     contract manufacturers when needed and market our products are     critical factors in gaining a competitive advantage. Competition     among products approved for sale includes product efficacy,     safety, convenience, reliability, availability, price,     third-party reimbursement and patent and non-patent exclusivity.     SIGNIFICANT     ALLIANCES         We have entered into a variety of alliances as is customary in     our industry. Following is a description of the major agreements     in place:     Novartis Pharma AG:  We entered into an     agreement with Novartis in which we granted to Novartis an     exclusive worldwide license (excluding Canada) to develop and     market     FOCALIN®      (d-methylphenidate, or d -MPH) and FOCALIN     XR®,      the long-acting drug formulation for attention deficit disorder,     or ADD, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.     We also granted Novartis rights to all of our related     intellectual property and patents, including formulations of the     currently marketed RITALIN     LA®.      Under the agreement, we are entitled to receive up to     $100.0 million in upfront and regulatory achievement     milestone payments. To date, we have received upfront and     regulatory achievement milestone payments totaling     $55.0 million. We also sell     FOCALIN®      to Novartis and currently receive royalties of between 35% and     30% on sales of all of Novartis FOCALIN     XR®      and     RITALIN®      family of ADHD-related products.         The agreement will continue until the later of (i) the     tenth anniversary of the first commercial launch on a     country-by-country     basis or (ii) when the last applicable patent expires with     respect to that country. At the expiration date, we shall grant     Novartis a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to     make, have made, use, import and sell d-MPH and     Ritalin®      under our technology.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         i. Novartis at its sole discretion, effective     12 months after written notice to us, or         ii. by:         a. either party if the other party materially breaches any     of its material obligations under the agreement,         b. us if Novartis fails to pay amounts due under the     agreement two or more times in a     12-month     period,         c. either party, on a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis, in the event of withdrawal of the d-MPH product or     Ritalin®      product from the market because of regulatory mandate,         d. either party if the other party files for bankruptcy.         If the agreement is terminated by us then all licenses granted     to Novartis under the agreement will terminate and Novartis will     also grant us a non-exclusive license to certain of their     intellectual property related to the compounds and products.         If the agreement is terminated by Novartis then all licenses     granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate.         If the agreement is terminated by Novartis because of a material     breach by us, then Novartis can make a claim for damages against     us and we shall grant Novartis a perpetual, non-exclusive,     royalty-free license to make, have made, use, import and sell     d-MPH and     Ritalin®      under our technology.         13    Table of Contents        When generic versions of long-acting methylphenidate     hydrochloride and dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride enter the     market, we expect Novartis sales of Ritalin     LA®      and Focalin     XR®      products to decrease and therefore our royalties under this     agreement to also decrease.     Array BioPharma Inc.:  We have a research     collaboration agreement with Array BioPharma Inc., or Array,     focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of     novel therapeutics in cancer and inflammation. As part of this     agreement, we made an upfront payment in September 2007 to Array     of $40.0 million, which was recorded as research and     development expense, in return for an option to receive     exclusive worldwide rights for compounds developed against two     of the four research targets defined in the agreement, except     for Arrays limited U.S. co-promotional rights. In     June 2009, we made an additional upfront payment of     $4.5 million to expand the research targets defined in the     agreement, which was recorded as research and development     expense. Array will be responsible for all discovery and     clinical development through Phase I or Phase IIa and be     entitled to receive, for each compound, potential milestone     payments of approximately $200.0 million if certain     discovery, development and regulatory milestones are achieved,     and $300.0 million if certain commercial milestones are     achieved as well as royalties on net sales. During the fourth     quarter of 2010, we made a $10.0 million discovery     milestone payment required by the collaboration upon the filing     and clearance of an IND with the FDA.         Our option will terminate upon the earlier of either a     termination of the agreement, the date we have exercised our     options for compounds developed against two of the four research     targets defined in the agreement, or September 21, 2012,     unless the term is extended. We may unilaterally extend the     option term for two additional one-year terms until     September 21, 2014 and the parties may mutually extend the     term for two additional one-year terms until September 21,     2016. Upon exercise of an option, the agreement will continue     until we have satisfied all royalty payment obligations to     Array. Upon the expiration of the agreement, Array will grant us     a fully     paid-up,     royalty-free license to use certain intellectual property of     Array to market and sell the compounds and products developed     under the agreement. The agreement may expire on a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect     to each product in each country.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         (i) us at our sole discretion, or         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches any of its material obligations     under the agreement, or         b. files for bankruptcy.         If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or     by Array for a material breach by us, then our rights to the     compounds and products developed under the agreement will revert     to Array. If the agreement is terminated by Array for a material     breach by us, then we will also grant to Array a non-exclusive,     royalty-free license to certain intellectual property controlled     by us necessary to continue the development of such compounds     and products. If the agreement is terminated by us for a     material breach by Array, then, among other things, our payment     obligations under the agreement could be either reduced by 50%     or terminated entirely.     Acceleron Pharma:  We have a worldwide     strategic collaboration with Acceleron Pharma, or Acceleron, for     the joint development and commercialization of ACE-011,     currently being studied for treatment of chemotherapy-induced     anemia, metastatic bone disease and renal anemia. The     collaboration combines both companies resources and     commitment to developing products for the treatment of cancer     and cancer-related bone loss. The agreement also includes an     option for certain discovery stage programs. Under the terms of     the agreement, we and Acceleron will jointly develop,     manufacture and commercialize Accelerons products for bone     loss. We made an upfront payment to Acceleron in February 2008     of $50.0 million, which included a $5.0 million equity     investment in Acceleron, with the remainder recorded as research     and development expense. In addition, in the event of an initial     public offering of Acceleron, we will purchase a minimum of     $7.0 million of Acceleron common stock.         Acceleron will retain responsibility for initial activities,     including research and development, through the end of Phase IIa     clinical trials, as well as manufacturing the clinical supplies     for these studies. In turn, we will conduct the Phase IIb and     Phase III clinical studies and will oversee the manufacture     of Phase III and commercial supplies. Acceleron will pay a     share of the development expenses and is eligible to receive     development, regulatory approval          14    Table of Contents        and sales-based milestones of up to $510.0 million for the     ACE-011 program and up to an additional $437.0 million for     each of the three discovery stage programs. The companies will     co-promote the products in North America. Acceleron will receive     tiered royalties on worldwide net sales, upon the     commercialization of a development compound.         The agreement will continue until we have satisfied all royalty     payment obligations to Acceleron and we have either exercised or     forfeited all of our options under the agreement. Upon our full     satisfaction of our royalty payment obligations to Acceleron     under the agreement, all licenses granted to us by Acceleron     under the agreement will become fully     paid-up,     perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable and royalty-free licenses.     The agreement may expire on a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect     to each product in each country.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         (i) us at our sole discretion, or         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches any of its material obligations     under the agreement, or         b. files for bankruptcy.         If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or     by Acceleron for a material breach by us, then all licenses     granted to us under the agreement will terminate and we will     also grant to Acceleron a non-exclusive license to certain of     our intellectual property related to the compounds and products.     If the agreement is terminated by us for a material breach by     Acceleron, then, among other things, (A) the licenses     granted to Acceleron under the agreement will terminate,     (B) the licenses granted to us will continue in perpetuity,     (C) all future royalties payable by us under the agreement     will be reduced by 50% and (D) our obligation to make any     future milestone payments will terminate.     Cabrellis Pharmaceuticals Corp.:  We, as a     result of our acquisition of Pharmion, obtained an exclusive     license to develop and commercialize amrubicin in North America     and Europe pursuant to a license agreement with Dainippon     Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd, or DSP. Pursuant to Pharmions     acquisition of Cabrellis Pharmaceutics Corp., or Cabrellis,     prior to our acquisition of Pharmion, we will pay     $12.5 million for each approval of amrubicin in an initial     indication by regulatory authorities in the United States and     the E.U. to the former shareholders of Cabrellis. Upon approval     of amrubicin for a second indication in the United States or the     E.U., we will pay an additional $10.0 million for each     market to the former shareholders of Cabrellis. Under the terms     of the license agreement for amrubicin, we are required to make     milestone payments of $7.0 million and $1.0 million to     DSP upon regulatory approval of amrubicin in the United States     and upon receipt of the first approval in the E.U.,     respectively, and up to $17.5 million upon achieving     certain annual sales levels in the United States. Pursuant to     the supply agreement for amrubicin, we are to pay DSP a     semiannual supply price calculated as a percentage of net sales     for a period of ten years. In September 2008, amrubicin was     granted fast-track product designation by the FDA for the     treatment of small cell lung cancer after first-line     chemotherapy.         The amrubicin license expires on a     country-by-country     basis and on a     product-by-product     basis upon the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the     first commercial sale of the applicable product in a given     country after the issuance of marketing authorization in such     country and (ii) the first day of the first quarter for     which the total number of generic product units sold in a given     country exceeds 20% of the total number of generic product units     sold plus licensed product units sold in the relevant country     during the same calendar quarter.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the amrubicin     license may be terminated by:         (i) us at our sole discretion,         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches any of its material obligations     under the agreement, or         b. files for bankruptcy,         (iii) DSP if we take any action to challenge the title or     validity of the patents owned by DSP, or         (iv) DSP in the event of our change in control.         15    Table of Contents          If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or     by DSP under circumstances described in clauses (ii)(a) and     (iii) above, then we will transfer our rights to the     compounds and products developed under the agreement to DSP and     will also grant to DSP a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free     license to certain intellectual property controlled by us     necessary to continue the development of such compounds and     products. If the agreement is terminated by us for a material     breach by DSP, then, among other things, DSP will grant to us an     exclusive, perpetual,     paid-up     license to all of the intellectual property of DSP necessary to     continue the development, marketing and selling of the compounds     and products subject to the agreement.     GlobeImmune, Inc.:  In September 2007, we made     a $3.0 million equity investment in GlobeImmune, Inc., or     GlobeImmune. In April 2009 and May 2009, we made additional     $0.1 million and $10.0 million equity investments,     respectively, in GlobeImmune. In addition, we have a     collaboration and option agreement with GlobeImmune focused on     the discovery, development and commercialization of novel     therapeutics in cancer. As part of this agreement, we made an     upfront payment in May 2009 of $30.0 million, which was     recorded as research and development expense, to GlobeImmune in     return for the option to license compounds and products based on     the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug     candidate programs as well as oncology compounds and products     resulting from future programs controlled by GlobeImmune.     GlobeImmune will be responsible for all discovery and clinical     development until we exercise our option with respect to a drug     candidate program and GlobeImmune will be entitled to receive     potential milestone payments of approximately     $230.0 million for the GI-4000 program, $145.0 million     for each of the GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 programs and     $161.0 million for each additional future program if     certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones are     achieved. GlobeImmune will also receive tiered royalties on     worldwide net sales.         Our options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and     GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs will terminate if we     do not exercise our respective options after delivery of certain     reports from GlobeImmune on the completed clinical trials with     respect to each drug candidate program, as set forth in the     initial development plan specified in the agreement. If we do     not exercise our options with respect to any drug candidate     program or future program, our option with respect to the     oncology products resulting from future programs controlled by     GlobeImmune will terminate three years after the last of the     options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and     GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs terminates. Upon our     exercise of an option, the agreement will continue until we have     satisfied all royalty payment obligations to GlobeImmune. Upon     the expiration of the agreement, on a     product-by-product, country-by-country     basis, GlobeImmune will grant us an exclusive, fully     paid-up,     royalty-free, perpetual license to use certain intellectual     property of GlobeImmune to market and sell the compounds and     products developed under the agreement. The agreement may expire     on a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect     to each product in each country.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         (i) us at our sole discretion, or         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches any of its material obligations     under the agreement, or         b. files for bankruptcy.         If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or     by GlobeImmune for a material breach by us, then our rights to     the compounds and products developed under the agreement will     revert to GlobeImmune. If the agreement is terminated by us for     a material breach by GlobeImmune, then, among other things, our     royalty payment obligations under the agreement will be reduced     by 50%, our development milestone payment obligations under the     agreement will be reduced by 50% or terminated entirely and our     sales milestone payment obligations under the agreement will be     terminated entirely.     Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:  On April 14,     2010, we entered into a discovery and development collaboration     and license agreement with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or     Agios, which focuses on cancer metabolism targets and the     discovery, development and commercialization of associated     therapeutics. As part of the agreement, we paid Agios a     $121.2 million non-refundable, upfront payment, which was     expensed by us as research and development in the second quarter     of 2010. We also made an $8.8 million equity investment in     Agios Series B Convertible Preferred          16    Table of Contents        Stock, representing approximately a 10.94% ownership interest in     Agios and is included in other non-current assets in our     Consolidated Balance Sheet. We receive an initial period of     exclusivity during which we have the option to develop any drugs     resulting from the Agios cancer metabolism research platform and     may extend this exclusivity period by providing Agios additional     funding. We have an exclusive option to license any resulting     clinical candidates developed during this period and will lead     and fund global development and commercialization of certain     licensed programs. With respect to each product in a program     that we choose to license, Agios could receive up to     $120.0 million upon achievement of certain milestones plus     royalties on sales, and Agios may also participate in the     development and commercialization of certain products in the     United States. Agios may also receive a one-time milestone     payment of $25.0 million upon dosing of the final human     subject in a Phase II study, such payment to be made only     once with respect to only one program.         Unless the agreement is earlier terminated or the option term is     extended, our option will terminate on April 14, 2013.     However, if certain development targets are not met, we may     unilaterally extend the option term: (a) for up to an     additional one year without payment; (b) subject to certain     criteria and upon payment of certain predetermined amounts to     Agios, for up to two additional years thereafter.         Following expiration of the option, the agreement will continue     in place with respect to programs to which we have exercised our     option or otherwise are granted rights to develop. The agreement     may expire on a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis as we satisfy our payment obligation with respect to each     product in each country. Upon the expiration of the agreement     with respect to a product in a country, all licenses granted by     one party to the other party for such product in such country     shall become fully     paid-up,     perpetual, sub licensable, irrevocable and royalty-free.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         (i) us at its sole discretion, or         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such     breach within the specified period, or         b. files for bankruptcy.         The party terminating under (i) or (ii)(a) above has the     right to terminate on a     program-by-program     basis leaving the agreement in effect with respect to remaining     programs. If the agreement or any program is terminated by us     for convenience or by Agios for a material breach or bankruptcy     by us, then, among other things, depending on the type of     program and territorial rights: (a) certain licenses     granted by us to Agios shall stay in place, subject to     Agios payment of certain royalties to us: and (b) we     will grant Agios a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free     license to certain technology developed in the conduct of the     collaboration and used in the program (which license is     exclusive with respect to certain limited collaboration     technology). If the agreement or any program is terminated by us     for a material breach or bankruptcy by Agios, then, among other     things, all licenses granted by us to Agios will terminate and:     (i) our license from Agios will continue in perpetuity and     all payment obligations will be reduced or will terminate;     (ii) our license for certain programs will become exclusive     worldwide: and (iii) with regard to any program where we     have exercised buy-in rights, Agios shall continue to pay     certain royalties to us.         We have determined that Agios is a variable interest entity;     however, we are not the primary beneficiary of Agios. Although     we would have the right to receive the benefits from the     collaboration and license agreement and it is probable that this     agreement incorporates the activities that most significantly     impact the economic performance of Agios for up to six years, we     do not have the power to direct the activities under the     collaboration and license agreement as Agios has the     decision-making authority for the Joint Steering Committee and     Joint Research Committee until we exercise our option to license     a product. Our interest in Agios is limited to our 10.94% equity     ownership and we do not have any obligations or rights to the     future losses or returns of Agios beyond this ownership. The     collaboration agreement, including the upfront payment and     series B convertible preferred stock investment, does not     entitle us to participate in future returns beyond the 10.94%     ownership and it does not obligate us to absorb future losses     beyond the $8.8 million investment in Agios Series B     Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, there are no other     agreements other than the collaboration agreement that entitle     us to receive returns beyond the 10.94% ownership or obligate us     to absorb additional losses.         17    Table of Contents    MANUFACTURING         We own and operate an FDA approved manufacturing facility in     Zofingen, Switzerland which produces the active pharmaceutical     ingredient, or API, for     REVLIMID®      and     THALOMID®      and have contracted with FDA approved Aptuit Inc. to provide     backup API manufacturing services in accordance with our     specifications. We also own and operate an FDA approved drug     product manufacturing facility in Boudry, Switzerland which is     used for the formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing     and distribution of     REVLIMID®      and     THALOMID®.      Our backup FDA approved drug product manufacturing service     providers include Penn Pharmaceutical Ltd. and Institute of Drug     Technology Australia Ltd. Our packaging service providers     include Sharp Corporation for worldwide packaging and Acino     Holding Ltd. for     non-U.S. packaging.         As a result of the acquisition of Abraxis, we obtained     manufacturing facilities in Melrose Park, Illinois; Phoenix,     Arizona; Oelwein, Iowa; Elk Grove Village, Illinois and     Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. A portion of the manufacturing     facility in Melrose Park has been leased to APP Pharmaceuticals,     Inc., or APP, and APP has agreed to provide certain contract     manufacturing services to us in accordance with the terms of the     manufacturing agreement. In addition, we lease from APP a     portion of APPs Grand Island, New York manufacturing     facility to enable us to perform our responsibilities under the     manufacturing agreement with APP for its term. The initial term     of the manufacturing agreement will expire on December 31,     2011, but could be extended for one year if either APP exercises     its option to extend the lease for our Melrose Park     manufacturing facility for an additional year or we exercise our     option to extend the lease for APPs Grand Island     manufacturing facility for an additional year.     ABRAXANE®      is manufactured at both the Melrose Park and Grand Island     facilities. The Puerto Rico facility is an API manufacturing     plant which is currently not in use.         Prior to a 2007 separation agreement, Abraxis and APP had been a     single company named American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. In     2007, American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. was separated into     two independent publicly traded companies: Abraxis which was     focused on oncology and research activities; and APP, which was     focused on hospital-based activities. After the separation, APP     was purchased by Fresenius, a publicly traded global health care     company.         The API for     VIDAZA®      is supplied by Ash Stevens, Inc. and Carbogen Amcis. We also     have contract manufacturing agreements with Baxter GmbH and Ben     Venue Laboratories, Inc., or Ben Venue, for     VIDAZA®      product formulation, filling vials and packaging. Our packaging     service provider for     non-U.S. packaging     is Catalent Pharma Solutions.         The API for     ISTODAX®      is supplied by Sandoz and Ben Venue provides the product     formulation, filling vials and packaging.         The API for     FOCALIN®      and FOCALIN     XR®      is currently obtained from two suppliers, Johnson Matthey Inc.     and Siegfried USA Inc., and we rely on a single manufacturer,     Mikart, Inc., for the tableting and packaging of     FOCALIN®      finished product.         CCT currently operates an FDA registered facility in Cedar     Knolls, New Jersey for the recovery and storage of cord blood     and placental stem cells for     LifeBankUSA®.      In addition, our Warren, New Jersey facility is FDA registered     for production of PDA-001, a culture-expanded placenta-derived     stem cell under cGMP to supply clinical studies. This is a     multi-purpose facility capable of supporting other products.     INTERNATIONAL     OPERATIONS         We have significant operations outside the United States     conducted both through our subsidiaries and through     distributors. Revenues from operations outside the United States     were 39.6% of total revenues in 2010, 35.6% of total revenues in     2009 and 29.8% of total revenues in 2008. The increase in the     percentage of total revenues from outside of the United States     is the result of our ongoing efforts to increase the     availability of our products to patients.         Our international headquarters and a drug product manufacturing     facility which performs formulation, encapsulation, packaging,     warehousing and distribution are located in Boudry, Switzerland.     We continue to expand our international regulatory, clinical and     commercial infrastructure and currently conduct our     international          18    Table of Contents        operations in over 65 countries and regions including Europe,     Latin America, Middle East, Asia/Pacific and Canada.         Our international operations are subject to risks associated     with operating on an international basis including currency     fluctuations, price and exchange controls and other restrictive     governmental actions. Our international operations are also     subject to government-imposed constraints including laws on     pricing, reimbursement and access to our products. Depending on     the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar,     foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported     dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. While     we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign     exchange rates or the effect they will have, we attempt to     mitigate their impact through operational means and by using     foreign currency forward contracts. See the discussions under     Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures     About Market Risk.     SALES AND     COMMERCIALIZATION         We endeavor to promote our brands globally through our highly     trained commercial organization that has significant experience     in the pharmaceutical industry, especially in the areas of     oncology and immunology. Our commercial organization supports     our currently marketed brands and prepares for the launches of     new products as well as new indications for existing products.     We have a team of dedicated Market Access professionals to help     physicians, patients and payers understand the value our     products deliver. Given our goal to ensure that patients who     might benefit from our therapies have the opportunity to do so     and given the complex reimbursement environment in the United     States, we offer the services of Celgene Patient     Support®.      Celgene Patient     Support®      provides a dedicated, central point of contact for patients and     healthcare professionals who use Celgene products. Celgene     Patient     Support®      is a free service that helps patients and healthcare     professionals navigate the challenges of reimbursement,     providing information about co-pay assistance, and answering     questions about obtaining Celgene products.         In most countries, we sell our products through our own sales     organizations. In some countries, particularly in Latin America,     we partner with other third-party distributors. (See Section     COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS above.) Generally, we     distribute our products through the commonly used channels in     local markets. However,     REVLIMID®      and     THALOMID®      (inclusive of Thalidomide     Celgene®      and Thalidomide     Pharmion®)      are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution     programs tailored to meet local competent authorities     specifications to help ensure their safe and appropriate     distribution and use.     EMPLOYEES         As of December 31, 2010, we had 4,182 full-time     company-wide employees, 526 of which were engaged primarily in     manufacturing, 1,983 engaged primarily in research and     development activities, 1,013 engaged primarily in sales and     commercialization activities and the remainder engaged primarily     in executive and general and administrative activities. The     number of full-time employees in our international operations     has grown from 1,051 at the end of 2009 to 1,273 at the end of     2010. We also employ a number of part-time employees and     maintain consulting arrangements with a number of researchers at     various universities and other research institutions around the     world.     FORWARD-LOOKING     STATEMENTS         Certain statements contained or incorporated by reference in     this Annual Report on     Form 10-K     are forward-looking statements concerning our business, results     of operations, economic performance and financial condition     based on our current expectations. Forward-looking statements     within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of     1933, as amended and within the meaning of Section 21E of     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange     Act, are included, for example, in the discussions about:                         strategy;                    new product discovery and development;                    current or pending clinical trials;           19    Table of Contents                          our products ability to demonstrate efficacy or an     acceptable safety profile;                    actions by the FDA;                    product manufacturing, including our arrangements with     third-party suppliers;                    product introduction and sales;                    royalties and contract revenues;                    expenses and net income;                    credit and foreign exchange risk management;                    liquidity;                    asset and liability risk management; and                    operational and legal risks.           From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in     other materials we release to the public, as well as oral     forward-looking statements. All our forward-looking statements     give our then current expectations or forecasts of future     events. None of our forward-looking statements are guarantees of     future performance, although we believe we have been prudent in     our plans and assumptions. Each forward-looking statement     involves risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate     assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially     from those implied by our forward-looking statement. Should     known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should     underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could     differ materially from past results and those anticipated,     estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you     consider our forward-looking statements. Given these risks,     uncertainties and assumptions, you are cautioned not to place     undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.         We have tried, wherever possible, to identify these     forward-looking statements by using words such as     forecast, project,     anticipate, plan, strategy,     intend, potential, outlook,     target, seek, continue,     believe, could, estimate,     expect, may, probable,     should, will or other words of similar     meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of     our future operations, business plans and prospects, prospective     products or product approvals, our strategies for growth,     product development and regulatory approval, our expenses, the     impact of foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies,     such as legal proceedings, and our financial performance and     results generally. You also can identify our forward-looking     statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to     historical or current facts.         We provide in this report a cautionary discussion of risks and     uncertainties relevant to our business under the headings     Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7.     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition     and Results of Operations. We note these factors as     permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of     1995. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate,     we think could cause our actual results to differ materially     from expected and historical results. You should understand,     however, that it is not possible to predict or identify all such     factors. Consequently, you should not consider the factors that     are noted to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or     uncertainties.         Except as required under the federal securities laws and the     rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,     or SEC, we disclaim and do not undertake any obligations to     update or revise publicly any of our forward-looking statements,     including forward-looking statements in this report, whether as     a result of new information, future events, changes in     assumptions, or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult     any further disclosure we make on related subjects in our     Quarterly Reports on     Form 10-Q     and Current Reports on     Form 8-K     filed with or furnished to the SEC.         20    Table of Contents          ITEM 1A.     RISK     FACTORS           The following statements describe the major risks to our     business and should be considered carefully. Any of these     factors could significantly and negatively affect our business,     prospects, financial condition, operating results or credit     ratings, which could cause the trading price of our common stock     to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we     may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known     to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could     also negatively affect our business, our results and operations.     We may     experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating     results which could cause our financial results to be below     expectations and cause our stock price to be     volatile.         We have historically experienced, and may continue to     experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating     results. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many     of which are outside our control, and may result in volatility     of our stock price. Future operating results will depend on many     factors, including:                         demand or lack of demand for our products, including demand that     adversely affects our ability to optimize the use of our     manufacturing facilities;                    the introduction and pricing of products competitive with ours,     including generic competition;                    developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products;                    regulatory approvals for our products and pricing determinations     with respect to our products;                    regulatory approvals for our and our competitors     manufacturing facilities;                    timing and levels of spending for research and development,     sales and marketing;                    timing and levels of reimbursement from third-party payers for     our products;                    development or expansion of business infrastructure in new     clinical and geographic markets;                    the acquisition of new products and companies;                    tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;                    timing and recognition of certain research and development     milestones and license fees;                    ability to control our costs;                    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and                    economic and market instability.       We are     dependent on the continued commercial success of our primary     products     REVLIMID®,      VIDAZA®,      THALOMID® and     ABRAXANE® and a significant decline in demand for or use of these     products or our other commercially available products could     materially and adversely affect our operating results.          During the next several years, the growth of our business will     be largely dependent on the commercial success of     REVLIMID®,      VIDAZA®,      THALOMID®,      and     ABRAXANE®.      We cannot predict whether these or our other existing or new     products will be accepted by regulators, physicians, patients     and other key opinion leaders as effective drugs with certain     advantages over existing or future therapies. We are continuing     to introduce our products in additional international markets     and to obtain approvals for additional indications both in the     United States and internationally. A delay in gaining the     requisite regulatory approvals for these markets or indications     could negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our     stock.         Further, if unexpected adverse experiences are reported in     connection with the use of our products, physician and patient     comfort with the product could be undermined, the commercial     success of such products could be adversely affected and the     acceptance of our other products could be negatively impacted.     We are subject to adverse event reporting regulations that     require us to report to the FDA or similar bodies in other     countries if our products are associated with a death or serious     injury. These adverse events, among others, could result in     additional regulatory controls, such as the performance of     costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to our     approved          21    Table of Contents        labeling, which could limit the indications or patient     population for our products or could even lead to the withdrawal     of a product from the market. Similarly, the occurrence of     serious adverse events known or suspected to be related to the     products could negatively impact product sales. For example,     THALOMID®      is known to be toxic to the human fetus and exposure to the drug     during pregnancy could result in significant deformities in the     baby.     REVLIMID®      is also considered fetal toxic and there are warnings against     use of     VIDAZA®      in pregnant women as well. While we have restricted distribution     systems for both     THALOMID®      and     REVLIMID®      and we endeavor to educate patients regarding the potential     known adverse events including pregnancy risks, we cannot ensure     that all such warnings and recommendations will be complied with     or that adverse events resulting from non-compliance will not     have a material adverse effect on our business.         It is necessary that our primary products achieve and maintain     market acceptance as well as our other products including     ISTODAX®,      FOCALIN     XR®      and the     RITALIN®      family of drugs. A number of factors may adversely impact the     degree of market acceptance of our products, including the     products efficacy, safety and advantages, if any, over     competing products, as well as the reimbursement policies of     third-party payers, such as government and private insurance     plans, patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects.     If we     do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products we     will be unable to sell our current products and products in     development.         Changes in law, government regulations or policies can have a     significant impact on our results of operations. The discovery,     preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, risk     evaluation and mitigation strategies (such as our     S.T.E.P.S.®      and     RevAssist®      programs), marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and     biologics are all subject to extensive laws and regulations,     including, without limitation, the U.S. Federal Food, Drug,     and Cosmetic Act, the U.S. Public Health Service Act,     Medicare Modernization Act, Food and Drug Administration     Amendments Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the     Sherman Antitrust Act, patent laws, environmental laws, privacy     laws and other federal and state statutes, including     anti-kickback, antitrust and false claims laws, as well as     similar laws in foreign jurisdictions. Enforcement of and     changes in laws, government regulations or policies can have a     significant adverse impact on our ability to continue to     commercialize our products or introduce new products to the     market, which would adversely affect our results of operations.         If we or our agents, contractors or collaborators are delayed in     receiving, or are unable to obtain all, necessary governmental     approvals, we will be unable to effectively market our products.         The testing, marketing and manufacturing of our products     requires regulatory approval, including approval from the FDA     and, in some cases, from the Environmental Protection Agency, or     EPA, or governmental authorities outside of the United States     that perform roles similar to those of the FDA and EPA,     including the EMA, EC, the Swissmedic, the Australian     Therapeutic Goods Administration and Health Canada. Certain of     our pharmaceutical products, such as     FOCALIN®,      fall under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 that requires     authorization by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA,     of the U.S. Department of Justice in order to handle and     distribute these products.         The regulatory approval process presents a number of risks to     us, principally:                         In general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many     years, and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and     the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible     to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent     regulatory approval;                    Delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the     regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or     other data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure     of the product to meet, a regulatory agencys requirements     for safety, efficacy and quality or, in the case of a product     seeking an orphan drug indication, because another designee     received approval first or receives approval of other labeled     indications;                    Requirements for approval may become more stringent due to     changes in regulatory agency policy, or the adoption of new     regulations or legislation;           22    Table of Contents                          The scope of any regulatory approval, when obtained, may     significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may     be marketed and reimbursed and may impose significant     limitations in the nature of warnings, precautions and     contra-indications that could materially affect the sales and     profitability of the drug;                    Approved products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject     to continuing and ongoing review, and discovery of previously     unknown problems with these products or the failure to adhere to     manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in     restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their     withdrawal from the market;                    Regulatory authorities and agencies of the United States or     foreign governments may promulgate additional regulations     restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products,     including specifically tailored risk evaluation and mitigation     strategies;                    Guidelines and recommendations published by various governmental     and non-governmental organizations can reduce the use of our     products;                    Once a product receives marketing approval, we may not market     that product for broader or different applications, and the FDA     may not grant us approval with respect to separate product     applications that represent extensions of our basic technology.     In addition, the FDA may withdraw or modify existing approvals     in a significant manner or promulgate additional regulations     restricting the sale of our present or proposed products. The     FDA may also request that we perform additional clinical trials     or change the labeling of our existing or proposed products if     we or others identify side effects after our products are on the     market;                    Products, such as     REVLIMID®,      that are subject to accelerated approval can be subject to an     expedited withdrawal if the post-marketing study commitments are     not completed with due diligence, the post-marketing     restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be inadequate to     assure the safe use of the drug, or evidence demonstrates that     the drug is not shown to be safe and effective under its     conditions of use. Additionally, promotional materials for such     products are subject to enhanced surveillance, including     pre-approval review of all promotional materials used within     120 days following marketing approval and a requirement for     the submissions 30 days prior to initial dissemination of     all promotional materials disseminated after 120 days     following marketing approval; and                    Our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, labeling and     promotional activities relating to our products as well as our     post-marketing activities are regulated by the FDA, the Federal     Trade Commission, The United States Department of Justice, the     DEA, state regulatory agencies and foreign regulatory agencies     and are subject to associated risks. In addition, individual     states, acting through their attorneys general, have become     active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of     prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false     advertising laws. If we fail to comply with regulations     regarding the promotion and sale of our products, appropriate     distribution of our products under our restricted distribution     systems, prohibition on off-label promotion and the promotion of     unapproved products, such agencies may bring enforcement actions     against us that could inhibit our commercial capabilities as     well as result in significant penalties.           Other matters that may be the subject of governmental or     regulatory action which could adversely affect our business     include:                         changes in laws and regulations, including without limitation,     patent, environmental, privacy, health care and competition laws;                    importation of prescription drugs from outside the U.S. at     prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign     countries;                    additional restrictions on interactions with healthcare     professionals; and                    privacy restrictions that may limit our ability to share data     from foreign jurisdictions.           We collect placentas and umbilical cord blood for our unrelated     allogeneic and private stem cell banking businesses. The     FDAs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research     currently regulates human tissue or cells intended for     transplantation, implantation, infusion or transfer to a human     recipient under 21 CFR Parts 1270 and          23    Table of Contents        1271. Part 1271 requires cell and tissue establishments to     screen and test donors, to prepare and follow written procedures     for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease and to     register the establishment with FDA. This part also provides for     inspection by the FDA of cell and tissue establishments. The FDA     recently announced that as of October 21, 2011, a BLA will     be required to distribute cord blood for unrelated allogeneic     use. Currently, we are required to be, and are, licensed to     operate in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and California. If     other states adopt similar licensing requirements, we would need     to obtain such licenses to continue operating our stem cell     banking businesses. If we are delayed in receiving, or are     unable to obtain at all, necessary licenses, we will be unable     to provide services in those states and this could impact     negatively on our revenues.     Sales     of our products will be significantly reduced if access to and     reimbursement for our products by governmental and other     third-party payers is reduced or terminated.         Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to     which the costs of our products will be paid by health     maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health     care management organizations, or reimbursed by government     health administration authorities, private health coverage     insurers and other third-party payers. Generally, in Europe and     other countries outside the United States, the     government-sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of     healthcare costs of patients. These health care management     organizations and third-party payers are increasingly     challenging the prices charged for medical products and     services. Additionally, the newly enacted Health Care Reform Act     has provided sweeping health care reform, which may impact the     prices of drugs. In addition to the newly enacted federal     legislation, state legislatures and foreign governments have     also shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment     programs, including price controls, restrictions on     reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic     products. The establishment of limitations on patient access to     our drugs, adoption of price controls and cost-containment     measures in new jurisdictions or programs, and adoption of more     restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and     measures, including the impact of the Health Care Reform Act,     could adversely impact our business and future results. If these     organizations and third-party payers do not consider our     products to be cost-effective compared to other available     therapies, they may not reimburse providers or consumers of our     products or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be     sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable     basis.         Our ability to sell our products to hospitals in the United     States depends in part on our relationships with group     purchasing organizations, or GPOs. Many existing and potential     customers for our products become members of GPOs. GPOs     negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes on an     exclusive basis, with medical supply manufacturers and     distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to     a GPOs affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are     not one of the providers selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals     and other members may be less likely to purchase our products,     and if the GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share     compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturers     products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of     the GPO for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our     failure to renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market     share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales,     financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure     you that we will be able to renew these contracts at the current     or substantially similar terms. If we are unable to keep our     relationships and develop new relationships with GPOs, our     competitive position may suffer.         We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most     countries outside the United States. International operations     are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls     and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing     emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other     countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and     usage of our products. Although we cannot predict the extent to     which our business may be affected by future cost-containment     measures or other potential legislative or regulatory     developments, additional foreign price controls or other changes     in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able     to charge for our current and future products, which could     adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.     Our     long-term success depends, in part, on intellectual property     protection.         Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and     enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to     technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business     without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The     patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical     companies, including ours, can be uncertain          24    Table of Contents        and involve complex legal and factual questions including those     related to our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (such     as our     S.T.E.P.S.®      and     RevAssist®      programs). In addition, the coverage sought in a patent     application can be significantly reduced before the patent is     issued.         Consequently, we do not know whether any of our owned or     licensed pending patent applications, which have not already     been allowed, will result in the issuance of patents or, if any     patents are issued, whether they will be dominated by     third-party patent rights, whether they will provide significant     proprietary protection or commercial advantage or whether they     will be circumvented, opposed, invalidated, rendered     unenforceable or infringed by others. Further, we are aware of     third-party U.S. patents that relate to, for example, the     use of certain stem cell technologies and cannot be assured as     to any impact to our potential products, or guarantee that our     patents or pending applications will not be involved in, or be     defeated as a result of, opposition proceedings before a foreign     patent office or any interference proceedings before the United     States Patent & Trademark Office, or PTO.         With respect to patents and patent applications we have     licensed-in, there can be no assurance that additional patents     will be issued to any of the third parties from whom we have     licensed patent rights, or that, if any new patents are issued,     such patents will not be opposed, challenged, invalidated,     infringed or dominated or provide us with significant     proprietary protection or commercial advantage. Moreover, there     can be no assurance that any of the existing licensed patents     will provide us with proprietary protection or commercial     advantage. Nor can we guarantee that these licensed patents will     not be either infringed, invalidated or circumvented by others,     or that the relevant agreements will not be terminated. Any     termination of the licenses granted to us by CMCC could have a     material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and     results of operations.         Because 1) patent applications filed in the United States     on or before November 28, 2000 are maintained in secrecy     until patents issue, 2) patent applications filed in the     United States on or after November 29, 2000 are not     published until approximately 18 months after their     earliest claimed priority date, 3) United States patent     applications that are not filed outside the United States may     not publish at all until issued, and 4) publication of     discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag     behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we, or our     licensors, were the first to make the inventions covered by each     of the issued patents or pending patent applications or that we,     or our licensors, were the first to file patent applications for     such inventions. In the event a third party has also filed a     patent for any of our inventions, we, or our licensors, may have     to participate in interference proceedings before the PTO to     determine priority of invention, which could result in the loss     of a U.S. patent or loss of any opportunity to secure     U.S. patent protection for the invention. Even if the     eventual outcome is favorable to us, such interference     proceedings could result in substantial cost to us.         We may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing     patents or we may be required to obtain licenses to such     patents. However, we do not know whether such licenses will be     available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.     Prosecution of patent applications and litigation to establish     the validity and scope of patents, to assert patent infringement     claims against others and to defend against patent infringement     claims by others can be expensive and time-consuming. There can     be no assurance that, in the event that claims of any of our     owned or licensed patents are challenged by one or more third     parties, any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge     will determine that such patent claims are valid and     enforceable. An adverse outcome in such litigation could cause     us to lose exclusivity relating to the subject matter delineated     by such patent claims and may have a material adverse effect on     our business. If a third party is found to have rights covering     products or processes used by us, we could be forced to cease     using the products or processes covered by the disputed rights,     be subject to significant liabilities to such third party     and/or be     required to license technologies from such third party. Also,     different countries have different procedures for obtaining     patents, and patents issued by different countries provide     different degrees of protection against the use of a patented     invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that     the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an     invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of     patents covering the same invention or that any judicial     interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the     claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the     judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued     in another country. Competitors have chosen and in the future     may choose to file oppositions to patent applications, which     have been deemed allowable by foreign patent examiners.     Furthermore, even if our owned or licensed patents are     determined to be valid and enforceable, there can be no     assurance that competitors will not be able to design around     such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative     technology. Additionally, for these same reasons, we cannot be     sure that patents of a broader scope than ours may be issued and     thereby create freedom to          25    Table of Contents        operate issues. If this occurs we may need to reevaluate     pursuing such technology, which is dominated by others     patent rights, or alternatively, seek a license to practice our     own invention, whether or not patented.         We also rely upon unpatented, proprietary and trade secret     technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality     agreements with our collaborative partners, employees,     consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored     researchers and other advisors. There can be no assurance that     these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will     not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any     such breach or that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and     technological advances will not otherwise become known to     others. In addition, there can be no assurance that, despite     precautions taken by us, others have not and will not obtain     access to our proprietary technology or that such technology     will not be found to be non-proprietary or not a trade secret.     Our     products may face competition from lower cost generic or     follow-on products and providers of these products may be able     to sell them at a substantially lower cost than     us.         Generic drug manufacturers are seeking to compete with our     drugs, and present an important challenge to us. Even if our     patent applications, or those we have licensed-in, are issued,     innovative and generic drug manufacturers and other competitors     may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of such     patents in court, requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and     costly litigation. Alternatively, innovative and generic drug     manufacturers and other competitors may be able to design around     our owned or licensed patents and compete with us using the     resulting alternative technology. If any of our issued or     licensed patents are infringed or challenged, we may not be     successful in enforcing or defending our or our licensors     intellectual property rights and subsequently may not be able to     develop or market the applicable product exclusively.         Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our     products, or upon the at-risk launch (despite     pending patent infringement litigation against the generic     product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one     of our products, we can quickly lose a significant portion of     our sales of that product, which can adversely affect our     business. In addition, if generic versions of our     competitors branded products lose their market     exclusivity, our patented products may face increased     competition which can adversely affect our business.         The FDA approval process allows for the approval of an ANDA or     505(b)(2) application for a generic version of our approved     products upon the expiration, through passage of time or     successful legal challenge, of relevant patent or non-patent     exclusivity protection. Generic manufacturers pursuing ANDA     approvals are not required to conduct costly and time-consuming     clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of their     products; rather, they are permitted to rely on the     innovators data regarding safety and efficacy. Thus,     generic manufacturers can sell their products at prices much     lower than those charged by the innovative pharmaceutical or     biotechnology companies who have incurred substantial expenses     associated with the research and development of the drug     product. Accordingly, while our products currently may retain     certain regulatory and or patent exclusivity, our products are     or will be subject to ANDA applications to the FDA in light of     the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and     Cosmetic Act. The ANDA procedure includes provisions allowing     generic manufacturers to challenge the effectiveness of the     innovators patent protection prior to the generic     manufacturer actually commercializing their products      the so-called Paragraph IV certification     procedure. In recent years, generic manufacturers have used     Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge the     applicability of Orange Book-listed patents on a wide array of     innovative pharmaceuticals, and we expect this trend to continue     and to implicate drug products with even relatively modest     revenues. During the exclusivity periods, the FDA is generally     prevented from granting effective approval of an ANDA. Upon the     expiration of the applicable exclusivities, through passage of     time or successful legal challenge, the FDA may grant effective     approval of an ANDA for a generic drug, or may accept reference     to a previously protected NDA in a 505(b)(2) application.     Further, upon such expiration event, the FDA may require a     generic competitor to participate in some form of risk     management system which could include our participation as well.     Depending upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities, any     such approval could be limited to certain formulations     and/or     indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any outstanding     exclusivities.         If an ANDA filer or a generic manufacturer were to receive     approval to sell a generic or follow-on version of one of our     products, that product would become subject to increased     competition and our revenues for that product would be adversely     affected.         26    Table of Contents        We have received a Paragraph IV Certification Letter dated     August 30, 2010, advising us that Natco Pharma Limited of     Hyderabad, India, or Natco, submitted an ANDA to the FDA. See     Part 1, Item 3, Legal Proceedings      Revlimid®      of this report for further discussion.     If we     are not able to effectively compete our business will be     adversely affected.         The pharmaceutical and biotech industry in which we operate is     highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant     technological change. Our present and potential competitors     include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as     well as specialty pharmaceutical firms, including, but not     limited to:                         Takeda and Johnson & Johnson, which compete with     REVLIMID®      and     THALOMID®      in the treatment of multiple myeloma and in clinical trials with     our compounds;                    Eisai Co., Ltd., SuperGen, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson,     which compete or may potentially compete with     VIDAZA®,      in addition Eisai Co., Ltd. potentially competes with     ABRAXANE®,      and in other oncology products in general;                    Amgen, which potentially competes with our TNF-α and kinase     inhibitors;                    AstraZeneca plc, which potentially competes in clinical trials     with our compounds and TNF-α inhibitors;                    Biogen Idec Inc. and Genzyme Corporation, both of which are     generally developing drugs that address the oncology and     immunology markets;                    Bristol Myers Squibb Co., which potentially competes with     ABRAXANE®,      and in clinical trials with our compounds and TNF-α     inhibitors, in addition to other oncology products in general;                    F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., which potentially competes     in clinical trials with our     IMiDs®      compounds and TNF-α inhibitors, in addition to other     oncology products in general;                    Johnson & Johnson, which potentially competes with     certain of our proprietary programs, including our oral     anti-inflammatory programs;                    Abbott Laboratories, which potentially competes with our oral     anti-inflammatory programs;                    Novartis, which potentially competes with our compounds and     kinase programs;                    Pfizer, which potentially competes in clinical trials with our     kinase inhibitors; and                    Sanofi-Aventis, which competes with     ABRAXANE®,      in addition to other oncology products in general.           Many of these companies have considerably greater financial,     technical and marketing resources than we do. This enables them,     among other things, to make greater research and development     investments and spread their research and development costs, as     well as their marketing and promotion costs, over a broader     revenue base. Our competitors may also have more experience and     expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA, and     other regulatory authorities. We also experience competition     from universities and other research institutions, and in some     instances, we compete with others in acquiring technology from     these sources. The pharmaceutical industry has undergone, and is     expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant     technological change, and we expect competition to intensify as     technical advances in the field are made and become more widely     known. The development of products, including generics, or     processes by our competitors with significant advantages over     those that we are seeking to develop could cause the     marketability of our products to stagnate or decline.     We may     be required to modify our business practices, pay fines and     significant expenses or experience losses due to litigation or     governmental investigations.         From time to time, we may be subject to litigation or     governmental investigation on a variety of matters, including,     without limitation, regulatory, intellectual property, product     liability, antitrust, consumer, whistleblower, commercial,     securities and employment litigation and claims and other legal     proceedings that may arise from the conduct of our business as     currently conducted or as conducted in the future.         27    Table of Contents        In particular, we are subject to significant product liability     risks as a result of the testing of our products in human     clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory     approval.         Pharmaceutical companies involved in Hatch-Waxman litigation are     often subject to follow-on lawsuits and governmental     investigations, which may be costly and could result in     lower-priced generic products that are competitive with our     products being introduced to the market.         In the fourth quarter of 2009, we received a Civil Investigative     Demand (CID) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,     or the FTC. The FTC requested documents and other information     relating to requests by generic companies to purchase our     patented     REVLIMID®      and     THALOMID®      brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to     believe that we have engaged in unfair methods of competition.     In the first quarter of 2010, the State of Connecticut     referenced the same issues as those referenced in the 2009 CID     and issued a subpoena. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we     received a second CID from the FTC relating to this matter. We     continue to respond to requests for information.         In the first quarter of 2011, we received a letter from the     United States Attorney for the Central District of California     informing us that we were under investigation relating to our     promotion of the drugs     THALOMID®      and     REVLIMID®      regarding off-label marketing and improper payments to     physicians. We are cooperating with the Unites States Attorney     in connection with this investigation.         On January 20, 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that     the jurisdiction of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board,     or the PMPRB, extends to sales of drugs to Canadian patients     even if the locus of sale is within the United States. This     means that our U.S. sales of     THALOMID®      brand drug to Canadian patients under the special access program     are subject to PMPRB jurisdiction from and after     January 12, 1995. In accordance with the ruling of the     Supreme Court of Canada, we have provided to-date data regarding     these special access program sales to the PMPRB. In light of the     approval of     THALOMID®      brand drug for multiple myeloma by Health Canada on     August 4, 2010, this drug is now sold through our Canadian     entity and is no longer sold to Canadian patients in the United     States. The PMPRBs proposed pricing arrangement has not     been determined. Depending on the calculation, we may be     requested to return certain revenues associated with these sales     and to pay fines. Should this occur, we would have to consider     various legal options to address whether the pricing     determination was reasonable.         Litigation and governmental investigations are inherently     unpredictable and may:                         result in rulings that are materially unfavorable to us,     including claims for significant damages, fines or penalties,     and administrative remedies, such as exclusion     and/or     debarment from government programs, or other rulings that     prevent us from operating our business in a certain manner;                    cause us to change our business operations to avoid perceived     risks associated with such litigation or investigations;                    have an adverse affect on our reputation and the demand for our     products; and                    require the expenditure of significant time and resources, which     may divert the attention of our management and interfere with     the pursuit of our strategic objectives.           While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our     insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount     of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible     to obtain insurance to protect against all potential risks and     liabilities. If any litigation or governmental investigation     were to have a material adverse result, there could be a     material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or     financial position. See also Legal Proceedings contained in     Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     The     development of new biopharmaceutical products involves a lengthy     and complex process, and we may be unable to commercialize any     of the products we are currently developing.         Many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid-stages of     research and development and will require the commitment of     substantial financial resources, extensive research,     development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing     scale-up and     regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale. This process     involves a high degree of risk and takes many years. Our product     development efforts with respect to a product candidate may fail     for many          28    Table of Contents        reasons, including the failure of the product candidate in     preclinical studies; adverse patient reactions to the product     candidate or indications or other safety concerns; insufficient     clinical trial data to support the effectiveness or superiority     of the product candidate; our inability to manufacture     sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development     or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient     manner; our failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the     required regulatory approvals for the product candidate, the     facilities or the process used to manufacture the product     candidate; or changes in the regulatory environment, including     pricing and reimbursement, that make development of a new     product or of an existing product for a new indication no longer     desirable. Moreover, our commercially available products may     require additional studies with respect to approved indications     as well as new indications pending approval.         The stem cell products that we are developing through our CCT     subsidiary may represent substantial departures from established     treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional     products and therapies which are now, or may be in the future,     manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and     biopharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, public attitudes may     be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe, and     stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or     the medical community.         Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in conducting clinical     studies, we can give no assurances that our studies will have a     positive result or that we will receive regulatory approvals for     our new products or new indications.     Manufacturing     and distribution risks including a disruption at certain of our     manufacturing sites would significantly interrupt our production     capabilities, which could result in significant product delays     and adversely affect our results.         We have our own manufacturing facilities for many of our     products and we have contracted with third-party manufacturers     and distributors to provide API, encapsulation, finishing     services packaging and distribution services to meet our needs.     These risks include the possibility that our or our     suppliers manufacturing processes could be partially or     completely disrupted by a fire, natural disaster, terrorist     attack, governmental action or military action. In the case of a     disruption, we may need to establish alternative manufacturing     sources for these products. This would likely lead to     substantial production delays as we build or locate replacement     facilities and seek and obtain the necessary regulatory     approvals. If this occurs, and our finished goods inventories     are insufficient to meet demand, we may be unable to satisfy     customer orders on a timely basis, if at all. Further, our     business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us     for any losses that may occur and we would have to bear the     additional cost of any disruption. For these reasons, a     significant disruptive event at certain of our manufacturing     facilities or sites could materially and adversely affect our     business and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to     predict market demand for our products, we may be unable to     sufficiently increase production capacity to satisfy demand or     may incur costs associated with excess inventory that we     manufacture.         In all the countries where we sell our products, governmental     regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing,     packaging, labeling, distribution and storing. All of our     suppliers of raw materials, contract manufacturers and     distributors must comply with these regulations as applicable.     In the United States, the FDA requires that all suppliers of     pharmaceutical bulk material and all manufacturers of     pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the United States achieve     and maintain compliance with the FDAs current Good     Manufacturing Practice regulations and guidelines. Our failure     to comply, or failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply     with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being     imposed on them or us, including fines, injunctions, civil     penalties, disgorgement, suspension or withdrawal of approvals,     license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating     restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could     significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. In     addition, before any product batch produced by our manufacturers     can be shipped, it must conform to release specifications     pre-approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical     product. If the operations of one or more of our manufacturers     were to become unavailable for any reason, any required FDA     review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier     could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products.         If our outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for     quality, quantity or timeliness, or do not achieve and maintain     compliance with all applicable regulations, our ability to     continue supplying such products at a level that meets demand     could be adversely affected.         29    Table of Contents        We have contracted with specialty distributors, to distribute     REVLIMID®,      THALOMID®,      VIDAZA®,      ABRAXANE®      and     ISTODAX®      in the United States. If our distributors fail to perform and we     cannot secure a replacement distributor within a reasonable     period of time, we may experience adverse effects to our     business and results of operations.         We are continuing to establish marketing and distribution     capabilities in international markets with respect to our     products. At the same time, we are in the process of obtaining     necessary governmental and regulatory approvals to sell our     products in certain countries. If we have not successfully     completed and implemented adequate marketing and distribution     support services upon our receipt of such approvals, our ability     to effectively launch our products in these countries would be     severely restricted.     The     consolidation of drug wholesalers and other wholesaler actions     could increase competitive and pricing pressures on     pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.         We sell our pharmaceutical products in the United States     primarily through wholesale distributors and contracted     pharmacies. These wholesale customers comprise a significant     part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in     the United States. This distribution network is continuing to     undergo significant consolidation. As a result, a smaller number     of large wholesale distributors and pharmacy chains control a     significant share of the market. We expect that consolidation of     drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains will increase competitive     and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including     us. In addition, wholesalers may apply pricing pressure through     fee-for-service     arrangements, and their purchases may exceed customer demand,     resulting in reduced wholesaler purchases in later quarters. We     cannot assure you that we can manage these pressures or that     wholesaler purchases will not decrease as a result of this     potential excess buying.     Risks     from the improper conduct of employees, agents or contractors or     collaborators could adversely affect our business or     reputation.         We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and     procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed     by our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators that     would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in     which we operate, including without limitation, employment,     foreign corrupt practices, environmental, competition and     privacy laws. Such improper actions could subject us to civil or     criminal investigations, monetary and injunctive penalties and     could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results     of operations and reputation.     The     integration of Abraxis and other acquired businesses may present     significant challenges to us.         We may face significant challenges in effectively integrating     entities and businesses that we acquire, such as Abraxis, and we     may not realize the benefits anticipated from such acquisitions.     Achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Abraxis     will depend in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses     in an efficient and effective manner. Our integration of Abraxis     involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:                         demands on management related to the increase in our size after     the acquisition;                    the diversion of managements attention from the management     of daily operations to the integration of operations;                    higher integration costs than anticipated;                    failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;                    difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;                    difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and     practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and     geographically dispersed personnel and operations; and                    difficulties in the integration of departments, systems,     including accounting systems, technologies, books and records,     and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards,     controls, including internal control over financial reporting     required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related     procedures and policies.           30    Table of Contents          If we cannot successfully integrate Abraxis we may experience     material negative consequences to our business, financial     condition or results of operations. Successful integration of     Abraxis will depend on our ability to manage these operations,     to realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by     offerings and expanded geographic market coverage and, to some     degree, to eliminate redundant and excess costs. Because of     difficulties in combining geographically distant operations, we     may not be able to achieve the benefits that we hope to achieve     as a result of the acquisition with Abraxis.     Our     inability to continue to attract and retain key leadership,     managerial, commercial and scientific talent could adversely     affect our business.         The success of our business depends, in large part, on our     continued ability to (i) attract and retain highly     qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and commercial     personnel, (ii) successfully integrate large numbers of new     employees into our corporate culture and (iii) develop and     maintain important relationships with leading research and     medical institutions and key distributors. Competition for these     types of personnel and relationships is intense.         Among other benefits, we use share-based compensation to attract     and retain personnel. Share-based compensation accounting rules     require us to recognize all share-based compensation costs as     expenses. These or other factors could reduce the number of     shares and options management and our board of directors grants     under our incentive plan. We cannot be sure that we will be able     to attract or retain skilled personnel or maintain key     relationships, or that the costs of retaining such personnel or     maintaining such relationships will not materially increase.     We     could be subject to significant liability as a result of risks     associated with using hazardous materials in our     business.         We use certain hazardous materials in our research, development,     manufacturing and general business activities. While we believe     we are currently in substantial compliance with the federal,     state and local laws and regulations governing the use of these     materials, we cannot be certain that accidental injury or     contamination will not occur. If an accident or environmental     discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by     prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of     properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup     obligations, damages and fines. This could result in substantial     liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and     financial resources. Additionally, the cost of compliance with     environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in     the future, requiring us to expend more financial resources     either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance     coverage.     Changes     in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our     results of operations.         We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and     various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and     international tax liabilities are dependent upon the     distribution of income among these different jurisdictions.     Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our     effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not     limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, the accounting     for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in     tax laws and rates, future levels of research and development     spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of     earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate,     the outcome of examinations by the U.S. Internal Revenue     Service and other jurisdictions, the accuracy of our estimates     for unrecognized tax benefits and realization of deferred tax     assets, and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. The     impact on our income tax provision resulting from the     above-mentioned factors may be significant and could have an     impact on our results of operations.     Currency     fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could increase our     costs and may cause our profitability to decline.         We collect and pay a substantial portion of our sales and     expenditures in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.     Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates     affect our operating results.         31    Table of Contents        We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign     currency risk, but not to engage in currency speculation. We use     these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions     and balance sheet exposures denominated in foreign currencies.     We use derivative instruments, including those not designated as     part of a hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to     movements in foreign exchange rates. The use of these derivative     instruments mitigates the exposure of these risks with the     intent to reduce our risk or cost but may not fully offset any     change in operating results that result from fluctuations in     foreign currencies. Any significant foreign exchange rate     fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and     results of operations.     We may     experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet     our financial reporting obligations.         As we continue to expand at a rapid pace, the development of new     and/or     improved automated systems will remain an ongoing priority.     During this expansion period, our internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in     our financial reporting. Such misstatements may result in     litigation     and/or     negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction     that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our     common stock.     The     decline of global economic conditions could adversely affect our     results of operations.         Sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on     reimbursement from government health administration authorities,     private health insurers, distribution partners and other     organizations. As a result of the current global credit and     financial market conditions, these organizations may be unable     to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment.     In addition, U.S. federal and state health authorities may     reduce Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and private     insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims. A reduction in     the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively     affect our product sales, revenue and cash flows.         Due to tightened global credit, there may be a disruption or     delay in the performance of our third-party contractors,     suppliers or collaborators. We rely on third parties for several     important aspects of our business, including portions of our     product manufacturing, royalty revenue, clinical development of     future collaboration products, conduct of clinical trials and     raw materials. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their     commitments to us, our business could be adversely affected.     The     price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you     may lose some or all of your investment in us.         The market for our shares of common stock may be subject to     disruptions that could cause volatility in its price. In     general, current global economic conditions have caused     substantial market volatility and instability. Any such     disruptions or continuing volatility may adversely affect the     value of our common stock. In addition to current global     economic instability in general, the following key factors may     have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock:                         results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with     our marketed products;                    fluctuations in our commercial and operating results;                    announcements of technical or product developments by us or our     competitors;                    market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in     particular;                    stock market conditions generally;                    changes in governmental regulations and laws, including, without     limitation, changes in tax laws, health care legislation,     environmental laws, competition laws, and patent laws;                    new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings;                    public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment     of the disease states that we are targeting;           32    Table of Contents                          patent or proprietary rights developments;                    changes in pricing and third-party reimbursement policies for     our products;                    the outcome of litigation involving our products or processes     related to production and formulation of those products or uses     of those products;                    other litigation or governmental investigations;                    competition; and                    investor reaction to announcements regarding business or product     acquisitions.           In addition, our operations may be materially affected by     conditions in the global markets and economic conditions     throughout the world, including the current global economic and     market instability. The global market and economic climate may     continue to deteriorate because of many factors beyond our     control, including continued economic instability and market     volatility, sovereign debt issues, rising interest rates or     inflation, terrorism or political uncertainty. In the event of a     continued or future market downturn in general     and/or the     biotechnology sector in particular, the market price of our     common stock may be adversely affected.     In     addition to the risks relating to our common stock, CVR holders     are subject to additional risks.         On October 15, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding     common stock of Abraxis BioScience, Inc. in connection with our     acquisition, contingent value rights or, CVRs, were issued under     a CVR agreement entered into by and between us and American     Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the trustee.     A copy of the CVR agreement was filed on     Form 8-A     with the SEC on October 15, 2010. Pursuant to the CVR     agreement, each holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a pro     rata portion, based on the number of CVRs then outstanding,     of certain milestone and net sales payments, each of the     following cash payments that we are obligated to pay. See     Note 2, Acquisitions, of the Notes to the Consolidated     Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.         In addition to the risks relating to our common stock, CVR     holders are subject to additional risks, including:                         an active public market for the CVRs may not develop or the CVRs     may trade at low volumes, both of which could have an adverse     effect on the resale price, if any, of the CVRs;                    because a public market for the CVRs has a limited history, the     market price and trading volume of the CVRs may be volatile;                    if the clinical approval milestones specified in the CVR     agreement are not achieved for any reason within the time     periods specified therein, and if net sales do not exceed the     thresholds set forth in the CVR agreement for any reason within     the time periods specified therein, no payment will be made     under the CVRs and the CVRs will expire valueless;                    since the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the CVRs is     unclear, any part of any CVR payment could be treated as     ordinary income and required to be included in income prior to     the receipt of the CVR payment;                    any payments in respect of the CVRs are subordinated to the     right of payment of certain indebtedness of ours;                    we may under certain circumstances redeem the CVRs; and                    upon expiration of our obligations to use diligent efforts to     achieve each of the CVR milestones and to sell     ABRAXANE®      or any of the other Abraxis pipeline products, we may     discontinue such efforts, which would have an adverse effect on     the value, if any, of the CVRs.       Our     business could be adversely affected if we are unable to service     our obligations under our recently incurred     indebtedness.         On October 7, 2010, we issued a total of $1.25 billion     principal amount of senior notes, consisting of the 2015 notes,     the 2020 notes and the 2040 notes, collectively referred to as     the notes. Our ability to pay interest on the notes, to repay     the principal amount of the notes when due at maturity, to     comply with the covenants of the notes or to          33    Table of Contents        repurchase the notes if a change of control occurs will depend     upon, among other things, continued commercial success of our     products and other factors that affect our future financial and     operating performance, including, without limitation, prevailing     economic conditions and financial, business, and regulatory     factors, many of which are beyond our control.         If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service the     debt service requirements under the notes, we may be forced to     take actions such as:                         restructuring or refinancing our debt, including the notes;                    seeking additional debt or equity capital;                    reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions,     investments or capital expenditures; or                    selling assets.           Such measures might not be successful and might not enable us to     service our obligations under the notes. In addition, any such     financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available     on economically favorable terms.     A     breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could     subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our     business.         We rely upon our information technology systems and     infrastructure for our business. The size and complexity of our     computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown,     malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy     breaches by employees and others who access our systems may pose     a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized     persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken     appropriate security measures to protect our data and     information technology systems, there can be no assurance that     our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems     that could adversely affect our business.     We     have certain charter and by-law provisions that may deter a     third-party from acquiring us and may impede the     stockholders ability to remove and replace our management     or board of directors.         Our board of directors has the authority to issue, at any time,     without further stockholder approval, up to     5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the     price, rights, privileges and preferences of those shares. An     issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third-party from     acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock.     Additionally, our board of directors has adopted certain     amendments to our by-laws intended to strengthen the     boards position in the event of a hostile takeover     attempt. These provisions could impede the stockholders     ability to remove and replace our management     and/or board     of directors. Furthermore, we are subject to the provisions of     Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an     anti-takeover law, which may also dissuade a potential acquirer     of our common stock.

At     December 31, 2010, the non-cancelable lease terms for our     operating leases expire at various dates between 2011 and 2018     and in some cases include renewal options. The total amount of     rent expense recorded for all leased facilities in 2010 was     $30.1 million.           ITEM 3.     LEGAL     PROCEEDINGS           We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various     patent, commercial and other claims; government investigations;     and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the     ordinary course of our business. These legal proceedings and     other matters are complex in nature and have outcomes that are     difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on     the Company.         35    Table of Contents        Patent proceedings include challenges to scope, validity or     enforceability of our patents relating to our various products     or processes. Although we believe we have substantial defenses     to these challenges with respect to all our material patents,     there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters,     and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of     patent protection for the drug at issue, which could lead to a     significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially     affect future results of operations.         Among the principal matters pending to which we are a party, are     the following:     REVLIMID®         We have publicly announced that we have received a notice letter     dated August 30, 2010, sent from Natco Pharma Limited of     India (Natco) notifying us of a Paragraph IV     certification alleging that patents listed for     REVLIMID®      in the Orange Book are invalid,     and/or not     infringed (the Notice Letter). The Notice Letter was sent     pursuant to Natco having filed an ANDA seeking permission from     the FDA to market a generic version of 25mg, 15mg, 10mg and 5mg     capsules of     REVLIMID®.      Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic     manufacturer may file an ANDA with a certification (a     Paragraph IV certification) challenging the     validity or infringement of a patent listed in the FDAs     Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence     Evaluations (the Orange Book) four years after     the pioneer company obtains approval of its New Drug     Application, or an NDA. On October 8, 2010, Celgene filed     an infringement action in the United States District Court of     New Jersey against Natco in response to the Notice Letter with     respect to United States Patent Nos. 5,635,517 (the     517 patent), 6,045,501 (the 501     patent), 6,281,230 (the 230 patent),     6,315,720 (the 720 patent), 6,555,554 (the     554 patent), 6,561,976 (the 976     patent), 6,561,977 (the 977 patent),     6,755,784 (the 784 patent), 7,119,106 (the     106 patent), and 7,465,800 (the     800 patent). If Natco is successful in     challenging our patents listed in the Orange Book, and the FDA     were to approve the ANDA with a comprehensive education and risk     management program for a generic version of lenalidomide, sales     of     REVLIMID®      could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic lenalidomide product, potentially reducing     our revenue.         Natco responded to our infringement action on November 18,     2010, with its Answer, Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims.     Natco has alleged (through affirmative defenses and     counterclaims) that the patents are invalid, unenforceable     and/or not     infringed by Natcos proposed generic productions. After     filing the infringement action, we learned the identity of     Natcos U.S. partner, Arrow International Limited, and     filed an amended complaint on January 7, 2011, adding Arrow     as a defendant.     ELAN     PHARMA INTERNATIONAL LIMITED         On February 23, 2011, the parties entered into a settlement     and license agreement for $78.0 million, whereby all claims     were resolved and we obtained the rights to certain patents in     and related to the litigation including rights to     U.S. Reissue Patent REI 41,884 (the Reissued     Patent), as well as all foreign counterparts, all of which     expire in 2016. Prior to the settlement, on July 19, 2006,     Elan Pharmaceutical Intl Ltd. filed a lawsuit against the     predecessor entity of Abraxis (Old Abraxis) in the     U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging     that Old Abraxis willfully infringed two of its patents by     making, using and selling the     ABRAXANE®      brand drug. Elan sought unspecified damages and an injunction.     In response, Old Abraxis contended that it did not infringe the     Elan patents and that the Elan patents are invalid and     unenforceable. Before trial, Elan dropped its claim that Old     Abraxis infringed one of the two asserted patents. Elan also     dropped its request for an injunction as to the remaining     patent. On June 13, 2008, after a trial with respect to the     remaining patent, a jury ruled that Old Abraxis had infringed     that patent, that Abraxis infringement was not willful,     and that the patent was valid and enforceable. The jury awarded     Elan $55.2 million in damages for sales of     ABRAXANE®      through the judgment date. For accounting purposes, Abraxis     assumed approximately a 6% royalty on all U.S. sales, moving     forward from the verdict, of     ABRAXANE®      brand drug, plus interest. The patent expired on     January 25, 2011.         36    Table of Contents    ABRAXIS     SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT         Abraxis, the members of the Abraxis board of directors and     Celgene Corporation are named as defendants in putative class     action lawsuits brought by Abraxis stockholders challenging the     Abraxis acquisition in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The     plaintiffs in such actions assert claims for breaches of     fiduciary duty arising out of the acquisition and allege that     Abraxis directors engaged in self-dealing and obtained for     themselves personal benefits and failed to provide stockholders     with material information relating to the acquisition. The     plaintiffs also allege claims for aiding and abetting breaches     of fiduciary duty against us and Abraxis.         On September 14, 2010, the parties reached an agreement in     principle to settle the actions pursuant to the Memorandum of     Understanding, or the MOU. Without admitting the validity of any     allegations made in the actions, or any liability with respect     thereto, the defendants elected to settle the actions in order     to avoid the cost, disruption and distraction of further     litigation. Under the MOU, the defendants agreed, among other     things, to make additional disclosures relating to the     acquisition, and to provide the plaintiffs counsel with     limited discovery to confirm the fairness and adequacy of the     settlement. Abraxis, on behalf of itself and for the benefit of     the other defendants in the actions, also agreed to pay the     plaintiffs counsel $600,000 for their fees and expenses.     Plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against us and Abraxis     relating to our acquisition of Abraxis, except claims to enforce     the settlement or properly perfected claims for appraisal in     connection with the acquisition of Abraxis by us.         On November 15, 2010, the parties executed and filed a     stipulation and settlement with the Court and plaintiffs filed a     motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement.     On January 26, 2011, the Court granted plaintiffs     motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement,     certified the class for settlement purposes only and approved     the form of notice of the settlement of the class action.

MANAGEMENTS     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS       Executive     Summary         Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively     we, our or us) is a global     integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the     discovery, development and commercialization of innovative     therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory     related diseases.         Our primary commercial stage products include     REVLIMID®,      VIDAZA®,      THALOMID®      (inclusive of Thalidomide     Celgene®      and Thalidomide     Pharmion®),      ABRAXANE®      and     ISTODAX®.      REVLIMID®      is an oral immunomodulatory drug primarily marketed in the     United States and select international markets, in combination     with dexamethasone, for treatment of patients with multiple     myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and for the     treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or     intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS,     associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or     without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.     VIDAZA®,      which is licensed from Pfizer, is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog     that has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA     hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re-expression.     VIDAZA®      is a Category 1 recommended treatment for patients with     intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the National     Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN and is marketed in the     United States for the treatment of all subtypes of MDS.     VIDAZA®      has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of     MDS through May 2011. In Europe,     VIDAZA®      is marketed for the treatment of certain qualified adult     patients and has been granted orphan drug designation for the     treatment of MDS and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML.     THALOMID®      is marketed for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma     and for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of     moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, an     inflammatory complication of leprosy and as maintenance therapy     for prevention and suppression of the cutaneous manifestation of     ENL recurrence.     ABRAXANE®,      which was obtained in the 2010 acquisition of Abraxis BioScience     Inc., or Abraxis, is a nanoparticle, albumin-bound paclitaxel     that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,     or FDA, in January 2005 for the treatment of metastatic breast     cancer.     ABRAXANE®      is based on a tumor-targeting platform known as     nab®      technology.     ISTODAX®,      which was obtained in the 2010 acquisition of Gloucester     Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Gloucester, was approved by the FDA     for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, in     patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.     ISTODAX®      has received both orphan drug designation for the treatment of     non-Hodgkins T-cell lymphomas, which includes CTCL and     peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, and fast-track status in     PTCL from the FDA. The European Agency for the Evaluation of     Medicinal Products, or EMA, has granted orphan status     designation for     ISTODAX®      for the treatment of both CTCL and PTCL. We also sell     FOCALIN®,      which is approved for the treatment of attention deficit     hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, exclusively to Novartis Pharma     AG, or Novartis.         Additional sources of revenue include a licensing agreement with     Novartis, which entitles us to royalties on FOCALIN     XR®      and the entire     RITALIN®      family of drugs, residual payments from GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK,     based upon GSKs     ALKERAN®      revenues through the end of March 2011, sale of services through     our Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary and other miscellaneous     licensing agreements.         We continue to invest substantially in research and development,     and the drug candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of     preclinical and clinical development. These candidates include     our     IMiDs®      compounds, which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and     having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important     properties, our leading oral anti-inflammatory agents and cell     products and, after the acquisition of Abraxis, our     nanoparticle, albumin-bound compounds. We believe that continued     acceptance of our primary commercial stage products,     participation in research and development collaboration     arrangements, depth of our product pipeline, regulatory     approvals of both new products and expanded use of existing     products provide the catalysts for future growth.         42    Table of Contents        The following table summarizes total revenue and earnings for     the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:                                                                                                                       % Change                                                     2010            2009                  Years Ended December 31,           Versus            Versus                  2010           2009           2008           2009           2008                 (In thousands $, except earnings per share)                    Total revenue            $       3,625,745               $       2,689,893               $       2,254,781                   34.8       %               19.3       %          Net income (loss) attributable to Celgene            $       880,512               $       776,747               $       (1,533,653       )               13.4       %               N/A              Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Celgene            $       1.88               $       1.66               $       (3.46       )               13.3       %               N/A                 Total revenue increased by $935.9 million in 2010 compared     to 2009 primarily due to the continued growth of     REVLIMID®      and     VIDAZA®      in both U.S. and international markets, in addition to     sales of Gloucester and Abraxis products subsequent to their     acquisition dates. Net income and diluted earnings per share for     2010 reflects the higher level of revenue, partly offset by     increased spending for new product launches, research and     development activities, expansion of our international     operations and additional costs related to the acquisitions of     Gloucester and Abraxis. Net income for 2010 also included an     $86.7 million increase in upfront payments related to     research and development collaboration arrangements compared to     2009.     Acquisition of Abraxis BioScience, Inc.:  On     October 15, 2010, or the acquisition date, we acquired all     of the outstanding common stock of Abraxis. The transaction,     referred to as the Merger, resulted in Abraxis becoming our     wholly owned subsidiary. The results of operations for Abraxis     are included in our consolidated financial statements from the     date of acquisition and the assets and liabilities of Abraxis     have been recorded at their respective fair values on the     acquisition date and consolidated with ours. Abraxis contributed     net revenues of $88.5 million and losses of     $43.0 million, after consideration of non-controlling     interest, for the period from the acquisition date through     December 31, 2010.         Prior to the Merger, Abraxis was a fully integrated global     biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery, development     and delivery of next-generation therapeutics and core     technologies that offer patients treatments for cancer and other     critical illnesses. Abraxis portfolio includes an oncology     compound,     ABRAXANE®,      which is based on Abraxis proprietary tumor-targeting     platform known as     nab®      technology.     ABRAXANE®,      the first FDA approved product to use the     nab®      technology, was launched in 2005 for the treatment of metastatic     breast cancer. Abraxis has continued to expand the     nab®      technology through a clinical program and a product pipeline     containing a number of     nab®      technology products in development. The acquisition of Abraxis     accelerates our strategy to become a global leader in oncology     by the addition of     ABRAXANE®      and the     nab®      technology to our portfolio.     Acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals,     Inc.:  On January 15, 2010, we acquired all     of the outstanding common stock and stock options of Gloucester.     The results of operations for Gloucester are included in our     consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition     and the assets and liabilities of Gloucester have been recorded     at their respective fair values on the acquisition date and     consolidated with ours. Gloucester contributed net revenues of     $15.8 million and losses of $50.3 million. Prior to     the acquisition, Gloucester was a privately held     biopharmaceutical company that acquired clinical-stage oncology     drug candidates with the goal of advancing them through     regulatory approval and commercialization. We acquired     Gloucester to enhance our portfolio of therapies for patients     with life-threatening illnesses worldwide.     Debt Issuance:  On October 7, 2010, we     issued a total of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior     notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal     amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2015, or the 2015 notes,     $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of     3.95% Senior Notes due 2020, or the 2020 notes, and     $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of     5.7% Senior Notes due 2040, or the 2040 notes, and,     together with the 2015 notes and the 2020 notes, referred to     herein as the notes. The notes were issued at     99.854%, 99.745% and 99.813% of par, respectively, and the     discount is amortized as additional interest expense over the     period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of     approximately $10.3 million have been recorded as debt     issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet and are     amortized as additional interest expense using the effective     interest rate method over the period from issuance through     maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in     arrears on April 15 and October 15 each year beginning     April 15, 2011 and the principal on each note is due in     full at their          43    Table of Contents        respective maturity dates. The notes may be redeemed at our     option, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price     defined in a make-whole clause equaling accrued and unpaid     interest plus the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the     notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the     remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal. If we     experience a change of control accompanied by a downgrade of the     debt to below investment grade, we will be required to offer to     repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their     principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We are     subject to covenants which limit our ability to pledge     properties as security under borrowing arrangements and limit     our ability to perform sale and leaseback transactions involving     our property.     Results     of Operations:     Fiscal     Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008     Total Revenue:  Total revenue and related     percentages for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and     2008 were as follows:                                                                                                                       % Change                                                     2010            2009                                                      versus            versus                  2010           2009           2008           2009           2008                 (In thousands $)                    Net product sales:                                                                                           REVLIMID     ®            $       2,469,183               $       1,706,437               $       1,324,671                   44.7       %               28.8       %          VIDAZA     ®                534,302                   387,219                   206,692                   38.0       %               87.3       %          THALOMID     ®                389,605                   436,906                   504,713                   (10.8       )%               (13.4       )%          ABRAXANE     ®                71,429                                                         N/A                   N/A              ISTODAX     ®                15,781                                                         N/A                   N/A              ALKERAN     ®                                   20,111                   81,734                   (100.0       )%               (75.4       )%          Other                28,138                   16,681                   19,868                   68.7       %               (16.0       )%                                                                                                Total net product sales            $       3,508,438               $       2,567,354               $       2,137,678                   36.7       %               20.1       %          Collaborative agreements and other revenue                10,540                   13,743                   14,945                   (23.3       )%               (8.0       )%          Royalty revenue                106,767                   108,796                   102,158                   (1.9       )%               6.5       %                                                                                                Total revenue            $       3,625,745               $       2,689,893               $       2,254,781                   34.8       %               19.3       %                                                                                                   Total revenue increased by $935.9 million, or 34.8%, to     $3.626 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting     increases of $456.4 million, or 26.3%, in the United     States, and $479.5 million, or 50.1% in international     markets. The $435.1 million, or 19.3%, increase in 2009     compared to 2008, included increases of $150.3 million, or     9.5%, in the United States and $284.8 million, or 42.3%, in     international markets.     Net     Product Sales:         Total net product sales for 2010 increased by     $941.1 million, or 36.7%, to $3.508 billion compared     to 2009. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of     $892.5 million, price decreases of $2.1 million and     the favorable impact from foreign exchange of     $50.7 million. The decrease in prices was primarily due to     increased Medicaid rebates resulting from the Health Care Reform     Act and an increase in rebates to U.S. and international     governments resulting from their attempts to reduce health care     costs.         Total net product sales for 2009 increased by     $429.7 million, or 20.1%, to $2.567 billion compared     to 2008. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of     $428.0 million and price increases of $61.5 million,     partly offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of     $59.8 million.         REVLIMID®      net sales increased by $762.7 million, or 44.7%, to     $2.469 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to     increased unit sales in both U.S. and international     markets. Increased market penetration and the increase in     treatment duration of patients using     REVLIMID®      in multiple myeloma contributed to U.S. growth. The          44    Table of Contents        growth in international markets reflects the expansion of our     commercial activities in over 65 countries in addition to     product reimbursement approvals and the launch of     REVLIMID®      in Japan in the latter part of 2010.         Net sales of     REVLIMID®      increased by $381.8 million, or 28.8%, to     $1.706 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was     primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and     international markets, reflecting increases in market     penetration and duration of therapy in the United States, in     addition to the expansion of our commercial activities in     international markets.         VIDAZA®      net sales increased by $147.1 million, or 38.0%, to     $534.3 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to     increased sales in international markets resulting from the     completion of product launches in key European regions during     the latter part of 2009 and the increase in treatment duration     of patients using     VIDAZA®.          Net sales of     VIDAZA®      increased by $180.5 million, or 87.3%, to     $387.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to     the December 2008 full marketing authorization granted by the     European Commission, or E.C., for the treatment of adult     patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell     transplantation with Intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according     to the International Prognostic System Score, or IPSS, or     chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, with     10-29 percent     marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, or AML with     20-30 percent     blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World Health     Organization, or WHO, classification of     VIDAZA®.      In addition, sales for 2008 only included     VIDAZA®      sales subsequent to the March 7, 2008 acquisition of     Pharmion.         THALOMID®      net sales decreased by $47.3 million, or 10.8%, to     $389.6 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to     lower unit volumes in the United States resulting from the     increased use of     REVLIMID®.          Net sales of     THALOMID®      decreased by $67.8 million, or 13.4%, to     $436.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was     primarily due to lower unit volumes in the United States     resulting from the increased use of     REVLIMID®,      partially offset by higher pricing and volume increases in     international markets.         ABRAXANE®      was obtained in the acquisition of Abraxis in October 2010 and     was approved by the FDA in January 2005 in the treatment of     metastatic breast cancer.         ISTODAX®      was obtained in the acquisition of Gloucester in January 2010     and was approved in November 2009 by the FDA for the treatment     of CTCL in patients who have received at least one prior     systemic therapy.     ISTODAX®      was launched in the first quarter of 2010.         ALKERAN®      net sales decreased by $61.6 million, or 75.4%, to     $20.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008. This product was     licensed from GSK and sold under our label through     March 31, 2009, the conclusion date of the     ALKERAN®      license with GSK.         The other net product sales category for 2010     includes sales of     FOCALIN®      and former Pharmion and Abraxis products to be divested. The     other net product sales category for 2009 includes     sales of     FOCALIN®      and former Pharmion products to be divested.     Gross to Net Sales Accruals:  We record gross     to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales     discounts, government rebates, and chargebacks and distributor     service fees.         REVLIMID®      is distributed in the United States primarily through contracted     pharmacies under the     RevAssist®      program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution     program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe and     appropriate distribution and use of     REVLIMID®.      Internationally,     REVLIMID®      is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution     programs tailored to meet local competent authorities     specifications to help ensure the products safe and     appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by     country and, depending upon the country and the design of the     risk-management program, the product may be sold through     hospitals or retail pharmacies.     THALOMID®      is distributed in the United States under our System     for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety, or     S.T.E.P.S.®,      program which we developed and is a proprietary comprehensive     education and risk-management distribution program with the     objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution     and use of     THALOMID®.      Internationally,     THALOMID®      is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution     programs tailored to meet local competent authorities     specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate     distribution and use of     THALOMID®.      These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the     country and          45    Table of Contents        the design of the risk-management program, the product may be     sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.     VIDAZA®      and     ABRAXANE®      are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical     industry supply chain and are not subject to the same     risk-management distribution programs as     THALOMID®      and     REVLIMID®.          We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand     retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as     reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and     other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where     product is still being returned or inventory centralization and     rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains,     as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these     estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change     in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a     determination is made and revenues in that period could be     materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual     returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots,     that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are     analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on     open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are     monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any     changes from the historical trend rates are considered in     determining the current sales return allowance.     REVLIMID®      is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted     pharmacies, lending itself to tighter controls of inventory     quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in     lower returns activity to date.     THALOMID®      is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a     result, wholesalers do not stock the product.         Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to     customers.         Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due     to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties     under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate     accruals are generally based on historical payment data and     estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to     the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for     Medicaid and Medicare Services. Full year 2010 revenues were     negatively impacted by the U.S. Health Care Reform Act     which increased the Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and     extended that rebate to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We     utilized historical patient data to estimate the incremental     costs related to the Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. In     addition, certain international markets have     government-sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid     based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate     accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.         Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale     customers, GPOs and end-user customers, consistent with     pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and     fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from date of     sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale     based on the contracted rates and historical redemption rates.     Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of     wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average     contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to     these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.         Chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between     product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower     government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered     under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee     accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the     wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health     care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military     Health System that provides civilian health benefits for     military personnel, military retirees and their dependents.     TRICARE rebate accruals are based on estimated Department of     Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.         See Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting     Policies for further discussion of gross to net sales accruals.         46    Table of Contents        Gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related     allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2010,     2009 and 2008 were as follows:                                                                                   Returns                                    Chargebacks                              and                        Government            and Distributor                              Allowances           Discounts           Rebates           Service Fees           Total                 In thousands $                    Balance at December 31, 2007            $       16,734               $       2,895               $       9,202               $       8,839               $       37,670              Pharmion balance at March 7, 2008                926                   283                   1,266                   2,037                   4,512              Allowances for sales during 2008                20,624                   36,024                   35,456                   100,258                   192,362              Credits/deductions issued for prior year sales                (17,066       )               (2,428       )               (7,951       )               (4,127       )               (31,572       )          Credits/deductions issued for sales during 2008                (3,419       )               (33,115       )               (27,163       )               (83,621       )               (147,318       )                                                                                                Balance at December 31, 2008            $       17,799               $       3,659               $       10,810               $       23,386               $       55,654              Allowances for sales during 2009                14,742                   37,315                   48,082                   88,807                   188,946              Credits/deductions issued for prior year sales                (13,168       )               (2,306       )               (11,042       )               (10,333       )               (36,849       )          Credits/deductions issued for sales during 2009                (12,013       )               (35,070       )               (29,739       )               (72,619       )               (149,441       )                                                                                                Balance at December 31, 2009            $       7,360               $       3,598               $       18,111               $       29,241               $       58,310              Abraxis balance at October 15, 2010                815                                      4,336                   7,253                   12,404              Allowances for sales during 2010                6,440                   52,975                   117,788                   123,625                   300,828              Credits/deductions issued for prior year sales                (5,764       )               (3,304       )               (14,437       )               (15,882       )               (39,387       )          Credits/deductions issued for sales during 2010                (4,072       )               (44,997       )               (40,834       )               (96,870       )               (186,773       )                                                                                                Balance at December 31, 2010            $       4,779               $       8,272               $       84,964               $       47,367               $       145,382                                                                                                   2010 compared to 2009:  Returns and allowances     decreased by $8.3 million in 2010 compared to 2009,     primarily due to reduced U.S. provisions resulting from     decreased revenue from products with higher return rates.         Discounts increased by $15.7 million in 2010 compared to     2009, primarily due to revenue increases in the United States     and international markets, both of which offer different     discount programs, and expansion into new international markets.         Government rebates increased by $69.7 million in 2010     compared to 2009, primarily due to an approximate     $28.4 million increase in Medicaid rebates resulting from     the Health Care Reform Act, $40.6 million from     reimbursement rate increases in certain international markets     and approvals in new markets and the inclusion of     ABRAXANE®      sales subsequent to the October 2010 acquisition of Abraxis.         Chargebacks and distributor service fees increased by     $34.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a     $17.7 million increase in chargebacks resulting from both     an increase in sales, including the addition of     ABRAXANE®,      and an increase in certain chargeback rates, which are closely     aligned with Medicaid rebate rates. Other increases included     $5.6 million from TRICARE due to increased utilization in     the current year, distributor service fees of $6.5 million     and $2.3 million resulting from the Health Care Reform Act.     2009 compared to 2008:  Returns and allowances     decreased by $5.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008     primarily due to the completion of an inventory centralization     and rationalization initiative conducted by a major pharmacy     chain during 2009, decreased revenue from products with a higher     return rate history in 2009 compared to 2008 and a decrease in     ALKERAN®      returns due to the March 31, 2009 conclusion of the     ALKERAN®      license with GSK. In addition, 2008 includes an increase in     THALOMID®      returns resulting from the anticipated increase in the use of     REVLIMID®      in multiple myeloma.         47    Table of Contents        Discounts increased by $1.3 million in 2009 compared to     2008 primarily due to revenue increases in the United States and     international markets, both of which offer different discount     programs.         Government rebates increased by $12.6 million in 2009     compared to 2008 primarily due to increased sales levels of     REVLIMID®      and     VIDAZA®      in the United States and international markets, as well as     reimbursement approvals in new markets.         Chargebacks and distributor service fees decreased by     $11.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to     reduced revenue from products with a higher chargeback history     in 2009 compared to 2008 and a decrease in     ALKERAN®      chargebacks, partially offset by an increase in international     distributor service fees due to certain programs commenced in     2009.     Collaborative Agreements and Other     Revenue:  Revenues from collaborative agreements     and other sources decreased by $3.2 million to     $10.5 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was     primarily due to receipt of a $5.0 million milestone     payment in 2009 which was not duplicated in 2010, partly offset     by an increase in licensing fees and the inclusion of Abraxis     other revenues subsequent to the October 2010 acquisition date.         Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources     decreased by $1.2 million to $13.7 million in 2009     compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the     elimination of license fees and amortization of deferred     revenues related to Pharmion subsequent to the March 7,     2008 acquisition and was partly offset by an increase in     milestone payments received in 2009.     Royalty Revenue:  Royalty revenue decreased by     $2.0 million to $106.8 million in 2010 compared to     2009. A $5.9 million decrease in residual payments earned     by us based upon GSKs     ALKERAN®      revenues subsequent to the conclusion of the     ALKERAN®      license with GSK was partly offset by a net $3.9 million     increase in royalties earned from Novartis based upon its     FOCALIN     XR®      and     RITALIN®      sales.         Royalty revenue increased by $6.6 million to     $108.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to     the 2009 inclusion of $9.0 million in residual     ALKERAN®      payments earned by us based upon GSKs     ALKERAN®      revenues subsequent to the conclusion of the     ALKERAN®      license with GSK. Royalty revenue related to Novartis     sales of     RITALIN®      decreased by $2.1 million from 2008.     Cost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of acquired     intangible assets):  Cost of goods sold and     related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2010,     2009 and 2008 were as follows:                                                           2010       2009       2008             In thousands $                Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired     intangible assets)            $       306,521               $       216,289               $       258,267              Increase (decrease) from prior year            $       90,232               $       (41,978       )           $       128,056              Percent increase (decrease) from prior year                41.7       %               (16.3       )%               98.3       %          Percent of net product sales                8.7       %               8.4       %               12.1       %             Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired     intangible assets) increased by $90.2 million to     $306.5 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was     primarily due to the inclusion of a $34.7 million inventory     step-up     amortization adjustment related to sales of     ABRAXANE®      subsequent to the October 15, 2010 acquisition date of     Abraxis, in addition to increased sales of     REVLIMID®      and     VIDAZA®,      partly offset by the elimination of higher cost     ALKERAN®      sales, resulting from the March 31, 2009 conclusion of the     GSK license agreement. As a percent of net product sales, cost     of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible     assets) increased to 8.7% in the 2010 compared to 8.4% in 2009     primarily due to the inventory     step-up     amortization for     ABRAXANE®.      Excluding the     step-up     adjustment, the cost of goods sold ratio for 2010 was 7.7%.         Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired     intangible assets) decreased by $42.0 million to     $216.3 million in 2009 compared to 2008 partly due to the     March 31, 2009 conclusion date of the     ALKERAN®      license with GSK, reducing cost of goods sold by approximately     $39.0 million compared to 2008. In addition, costs related     to     THALOMID®      decreased as a result of lower unit volumes. Finally, 2008     included a $24.6 million inventory     step-up     adjustment related to the March 7, 2008 acquisition of     Pharmion compared to an adjustment of $0.4 million included     in 2009. The impact of these reductions was partly offset by     higher costs related to increased          48    Table of Contents        unit volumes for     REVLIMID®      and     VIDAZA®.      As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding     amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 8.4% in     2009 from 12.1% in 2008 primarily due to lower     ALKERAN®      sales, which carried a higher cost to sales ratio relative to     our other products, and the decrease in the inventory     step-up     adjustment.     Research and Development:  Research and     development expenses and related percentages for the years ended     December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:                                                           2010       2009       2008             In thousands $                Research and development            $       1,128,495               $       794,848               $       931,218              Increase (decrease) from prior year            $       333,647               $       (136,370       )           $       530,762              Percent increase (decrease) from prior year                42.0       %               (14.6       )%               132.5       %          Percent of total revenue                31.1       %               29.5       %               41.3       %             Research and development expenses increased by     $333.6 million to $1.128 billion in 2010 compared to     2009, partly due to an increase of $86.7 million in upfront     payments related to research and development collaboration     arrangements. A $121.2 million upfront payment was made to     Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Agios, in 2010, compared to a     combined $34.5 million in payments made to GlobeImmune,     Inc., or GlobeImmune, and Array BioPharma, Inc., or Array, in     2009. In addition, 2010 included $65.6 million in expenses     related to Abraxis and Gloucester subsequent to their     acquisition dates, an increase of approximately     $55.0 million in salary and benefits related to an increase     in employees, an increase of approximately $50.0 million in     research and development project spending and increases in     spending in support of multiple programs across a broad range of     diseases.         Research and development expenses decreased by     $136.4 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a     $303.1 million charge included in 2008 for a royalty     obligation payment to Pfizer that related to the yet to be     approved forms of     VIDAZA®      partly offset by 2009 spending increases related to drug     discovery and clinical research and development in support of     multiple programs across a broad range of diseases. Included in     2009 were upfront payments of $30.0 million and     $4.5 million to GlobeImmune and Array, respectively,     related to research and development collaboration agreements.     Included in 2008 was an upfront payment of $45.0 million     made to Acceleron Pharma, Inc. related to a research and     development collaboration agreement.         The following table provides a breakdown of research and     development expenses:                                                           2010           2009           Increase                 In thousands $                    Human pharmaceutical clinical programs            $       480,491               $       371,189               $       109,302              Other pharmaceutical programs(1)                505,518                   323,702                   181,816              Drug discovery and development                120,362                   85,208                   35,154              Placental stem cell                22,124                   14,749                   7,375                                                                    Total            $       1,128,495               $       794,848               $       333,647                                                                                 (1)        Other pharmaceutical programs include spending for toxicology,     analytical research and development, quality and regulatory     affairs and upfront payments for research and development     collaboration arrangements.          Research and development expenditures support multiple ongoing     clinical proprietary development programs for     REVLIMID®      and  other     IMiDs®      compounds;     VIDAZA®;      ABRAXANE®      in melanoma, non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancers; ABI     compounds, which are targeted nanoparticle, albumin-bound     compounds for treatment of solid tumor cancers; amrubicin, our     lead compound for small cell lung cancer; apremilast (CC-10004),     our lead anti-inflammatory compound that inhibits multiple     proinflammatory mediators and which is currently being evaluated     in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of psoriasis     and psoriatic arthritis; pomalidomide, which is currently being     evaluated in Phase I, II and III clinical trials;     CC-11050, for which Phase II clinical trials are planned;     our kinase inhibitor programs; as well as our cell therapy     programs.         49    Table of Contents    Selling, General and Administrative:  Selling,     general and administrative expenses and related percentages for     the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as     follows:                                                           2010       2009       2008             In thousands $                Selling, general and administrative            $       950,634               $       753,827               $       685,547              Increase from prior year            $       196,807               $       68,280               $       244,585              Percent increase from prior year                26.1       %               10.0       %               55.5       %          Percent of total revenue                26.2       %               28.0       %               30.4       %             Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by     $196.8 million to $950.6 million in 2010 compared to     2009, partly due to the inclusion of $50.0 million in     expenses related to former Abraxis and Gloucester subsequent to     their acquisition dates, a $19.1 million increase in     facilities costs and a $11.7 million increase in donations     to non-profit foundations. The remaining increase includes     higher marketing and sales related expenses, resulting from     ongoing product launch activities of     VIDAZA®      in Europe and     ISTODAX®      in the United States, in addition to the continued expansion of     our international commercial activities and an increase in     facilities costs.         Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by     $68.3 million to $753.8 million in 2009 compared to     2008, primarily reflecting increases in marketing and sales     related expenses of $75.1 million, which were partly offset     by a $6.7 million reduction in bad debt expense and other     customer account charges. Marketing and sales related expenses     in 2009 included product launch activities for     REVLIMID®,      VIDAZA®      and     THALOMID®      in Europe, Canada and Australia, in addition to     VIDAZA®      relaunch expenses in the United States upon receipt of an     expanded FDA approval to reflect new overall survival data. The     increase in expense also reflects the continued expansion of our     international commercial activities.     Amortization of Acquired Intangible     Assets:  Amortization of acquired intangible     assets is summarized below for the years ended December 31,     2010, 2009 and 2008:                                                           2010           2009           2008                 In thousands $                    Abraxis acquisition            $       21,648               $                      $                     Gloucester acquisition                21,833                                                    Pharmion acquisition                159,750                   83,403                   102,331              Penn T acquisition                                                      1,636                                                                    Total amortization            $       203,231               $       83,403               $       103,967              Increase (decrease) from prior year            $       119,828               $       (20,564       )           $       94,897                 Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased by     $119.8 million to $203.2 million in 2010 compared to     2009, primarily due to $95.8 million of incremental expense     associated with an acceleration of amortization beginning in     2010 related to the     VIDAZA®      intangible resulting from the acquisition of Pharmion. The     revised monthly amortization reflects an updated sales forecast     related to     VIDAZA®.      An increase in amortization expense due to the initiation of     amortization related to the Abraxis and Gloucester acquired     intangibles was partly offset by a reduction in expense     associated with certain developed product rights obtained in the     Pharmion acquisition becoming fully amortized during 2009.         Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by     $20.6 million to $83.4 million in 2009 compared to     2008 primarily due to several intangible assets obtained in the     Pharmion acquisition in March 2008 becoming fully amortized     during the fourth quarter of 2008 and third quarter of 2009.     Acquisition Related Charges and Restructuring,     net:  Acquisition related charges and     restructuring, net was $47.2 million in 2010 and included     $22.7 million in accretion of the contingent consideration     related to the acquisition of Gloucester in January 2010 and     $24.5 million in net costs related to the acquisition of     Abraxis in October 2010. In addition to acquisition related fees     of $21.4 million, the costs related to Abraxis included     restructuring costs of $16.1 million, partly offset by a     $13.0 favorable adjustment to the fair value of our liability     related to publicly traded contingent value rights, or CVRs,     that were issued as part of the acquisition of Abraxis. The     restructuring costs are primarily severance related and are     expected to be incurred in both 2011 and 2012.         50    Table of Contents    Interest and Investment Income, Net:  Interest     and investment income, net is summarized below for the years     ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:                                                           2010       2009       2008             In thousands $                Interest and investment income, net            $       44,757               $       76,785               $       84,835              Decrease from prior year            $       (32,028       )           $       (8,050       )           $       (24,978       )          Percentage decrease from prior year                (41.7       )%               (9.5       )%               (22.7       )%             Interest and investment income, net decreased by     $32.0 million to $44.8 million in 2010 compared to     2009. The decrease was primarily due to a $19.6 million net     reduction in gains on sales of marketable securities in 2010     compared to 2009 and a $13.6 million reduction in interest     income due to lower overall yields and the liquidation of     securities to fund the Abraxis acquisition.         Interest and investment income decreased by $8.1 million to     $76.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to     reduced yields on invested balances, partly offset by higher     invested balances.     Equity in Losses of Affiliated     Companies:  Under the equity method of accounting,     we recorded losses of $1.9 million, $1.1 million and     $9.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The loss     for 2010 included $1.3 million in losses from former     Abraxis equity method investments. The loss for 2008 included     impairment losses of $6.0 million which were based on an     evaluation of several factors, including an     other-than-temporary     decrease in fair value of an equity method investment below our     cost.     Interest Expense:  Interest expense was     $12.6 million, $2.0 million and $4.4 million in     2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $10.6 million     increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the interest     accrued on the $1.25 billion in senior notes issued in     October 2010.     Other income, net:  Other income, net is     summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2010,     2009 and 2008:                                                           2010       2009       2008             In thousands $                Other income (expense), net            $       (7,220       )           $       60,461               $       24,722              Increase (decrease) in income from prior year            $       (67,681       )           $       35,739               $       27,072                 Other income, net decreased by $67.7 million in 2010 to a     net expense of $7.2 million compared to an income of     $60.5 million in 2009 primarily due to a reduction in net     gains on foreign currency forward contracts that had not been     designated as hedges entered into in order to offset net foreign     exchange gains and losses.         Other income increased by $35.7 million to     $60.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to     transaction exchange gains and net gains on foreign currency     forward contracts that had not been designated as hedges. In     addition, 2008 included an impairment loss of $4.1 million.     Income Tax Provision:  The income tax provision     decreased by $66.5 million to $132.4 million in 2010     compared to 2009. The 2010 effective tax rate of 13.1% reflects     the impact from our low tax Swiss manufacturing operations, our     overall global mix of income, and tax deductions related to our     acquisitions. The income tax provision in 2010 includes the     favorable impact of a shift in earnings between the     U.S. and lower tax foreign jurisdictions. The income tax     provision in 2010 also includes certain discrete items including     a tax benefit of $12.5 million related to the settlement of     a tax examination, a tax benefit of $5.4 million which was     primarily the result of filing our 2009 income tax returns with     certain items being more favorable than originally estimated,     and a tax benefit of $19.8 million for the reduction in a     valuation allowance related to certain tax carryforwards,     partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits     related to certain ongoing income tax audits.         The income tax provision increased by $34.2 million to     $199.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The 2009 effective     tax rate of 20.4% reflected the impact from our low tax Swiss     manufacturing operations and our overall global mix of income.     The income tax provision in 2009 included the favorable impact     of a shift in earnings between the U.S. and lower tax     foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2009 also     included a $17.0 million net tax benefit which was     primarily the result of filing our 2008 income tax returns with     certain items being more          51    Table of Contents        favorable than originally estimated, the reduction in a     valuation allowance related to capital loss carryforwards, and     the settlement of tax examinations, partially offset by an     increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to certain ongoing     income tax audits.     Net income (loss):  Net income (loss) and per     common share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2010,     2009 and 2008 were as follows:                                                           2010       2009       2008             In thousands $, except per share amounts                Net income (loss) attributable to Celgene            $       880,512               $       776,747               $       (1,533,653       )          Per common share amounts:                                                           Basic            $       1.90               $       1.69               $       (3.46       )          Diluted(1)            $       1.88               $       1.66               $       (3.46       )          Weighted average shares:                                                           Basic                462,298                   459,304                   442,620              Diluted                469,517                   467,354                   442,620                           (1)        In computing diluted earnings per share for 2008, no adjustment     to the numerator or denominator was made due to the     anti-dilutive effect of any potential common stock as a result     of our net loss. As of their maturity date, June 1, 2008,     substantially all of our convertible notes were converted into     shares of common stock.          Net income for 2010 reflect the earnings impact from higher     sales of     REVLIMID®      and     VIDAZA®.      The favorable impact of higher revenues was partly offset by     increased spending for new product launches, research and     development activities, expansion of our international     operations and the additional costs and intangible amortization     related to acquisitions.         Net income for 2009 reflects the earnings impact from higher     sales of     REVLIMID®      and     VIDAZA®,      which was partly due to sales increases in the United States and     our continued expansion into new international markets and the     granting of full marketing authorization by the European     Commission, or E.C., of     VIDAZA®      for specified treatment of adult patients. The earnings     generated from increased sales were partly offset by increased     spending on research and development, the costs related to new     product launches and our ongoing expansion of international     operations. The net loss for 2008 included $1.74 billion in     IPR&D charges related to our acquisition of Pharmion and a     $303.1 million charge for the October 2008 royalty     obligation payment to Pfizer related to unapproved forms of     VIDAZA®.      Liquidity     and Capital Resources         Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities     for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were     as follows:                                                                                                           Increase (Decrease)                                     2010        2009                                      versus        versus              2010       2009       2008       2009       2008             In thousands $                Net cash provided by operating activities            $       1,181,556               $       909,855               $       182,187               $       271,701               $       727,668              Net cash used in investing activities            $       (2,107,305       )           $       (856,078       )           $       (522,246       )           $       (1,251,227       )           $       (333,832       )          Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities            $       1,177,167               $       (61,872       )           $       281,629               $       1,239,039               $       (343,501       )         Operating Activities:  Net cash provided by     operating activities in 2010 increased by $271.7 million to     $1,181.6 million as compared to 2009. The increase in net     cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable     to an expansion of our operations and related increase in net     earnings, partially offset by the increase in accounts     receivable associated with expanding international sales, which     take longer to collect and the timing of receipts and payments     in the ordinary course of business.         52    Table of Contents    Investing Activities:  Net cash used in     investing activities in 2010 increased by $1.251 billion to     $2.107 billion as compared to a net cash use of     $856.1 million in 2009. The 2010 investing activities are     principally related to proceeds from the sales of marketable     securities that were sold in preparation for the purchase of     Abraxis and net cash used in the acquisition of Abraxis of     $2.315 billion and the acquisition of Gloucester of     $337.6 million. Net sales of marketable securities     available for sale amounted to $659.7 million in 2010     compared to net purchases of $749.3 million in 2009.     Financing Activities:  Net cash provided by     financing activities in 2010 was $1.177 billion compared to     a net cash usage of $61.9 million in 2009. The     $1.239 billion increase in net cash provided by financing     activities in 2010 was primarily attributable to proceeds from     the issuance of long-term debt in 2010 that provided net cash of     $1.237 billion.     Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities Available for     Sale and Working Capital:  Cash, cash equivalents,     marketable securities available for sale and working capital for     the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:                                                                           2010              2010       2009       Increase             In thousands $                Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for     sale            $       2,601,301               $       2,996,752               $       (395,451       )          Working capital(1)            $       2,835,427               $       3,302,109               $       (466,682       )                       (1)        Includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities     available for sale, accounts receivable, net of allowances,     inventory and other current assets, less accounts payable,     accrued expenses, income taxes payable and other current     liabilities.      Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available     for Sale:  We invest our excess cash primarily in     money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed     securities,     non-U.S. government,     agency and Supranational securities and global corporate debt     securities. All liquid investments with maturities of three     months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash     equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than     three months from the date of purchase are classified as     marketable securities available for sale. We determine the     appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt     and equity securities at the time of purchase. The     $395.5 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and     marketable securities available for sale at the end of 2010     compared to 2009 was primarily due to the $2.315 billion     net cash payment made for the Abraxis acquisition,     $337.6 million net cash payment made for the Gloucester     acquisition, $121.2 million upfront payment made to Agios     related to a research and development collaboration arrangement     and $183.1 million cash paid out under our share repurchase     program announced in April 2009, partly offset by     $1.237 billion in net proceeds from our debt issuance in     October 2010 and cash generated from operations.     Accounts Receivable, Net:  Accounts receivable,     net increased by $267.8 million to $706.4 million in     2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased U.S. and     international sales of     REVLIMID®      and     VIDAZA®      among existing customers as well as new customers in countries     we have recently entered and the inclusion of $52.7 million     in accounts receivable related to our acquisition of Abraxis in     October 2010. Days of sales outstanding at the end of 2010     increased to 59 days compared to 56 days in 2009. The     increase in days of sales outstanding was primarily due to     increased international sales in countries where payment terms     are typically greater than 60 days, thereby extending     collection periods beyond those in the United States. We expect     this trend to continue as our international sales continue to     expand.     Inventory:  Inventory balances increased by     $159.4 million to $260.1 million at the end of 2010     compared to 2009, primarily due to the inclusion of     $136.7 million in     ABRAXANE®      inventory, which included a $90.3 million inventory     step-up     adjustment to fair value resulting from the acquisition of     Abraxis in October 2010.     Other Current Assets:  Other current assets     increased by $16.1 million to $275.0 million at the     end of 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increases in     prepaid value added taxes, income taxes and an increase in the     fair          53    Table of Contents        value of foreign currency forward contracts, partly offset by a     decrease in prepaid royalties related to     VIDAZA®      sales and interest receivable on short-term investments.     Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Current     Liabilities:  Accounts payable, accrued expenses     and other current liabilities increased by $550.0 million     to $996.0 million at the end of 2010 compared to 2009. The     increase was primarily due to the $171.9 million current     portion of the contingent consideration related to the     acquisition of Gloucester, increases in governmental rebates and     Medicaid reimbursements, increased value added taxes, increased     royalties and payroll-related and other accruals.     Income Taxes Payable (Current and     Non-Current):  Income taxes payable increased by     $94.1 million to $563.3 million at the end of 2010     compared to 2009 primarily from the current provision for income     taxes of $236.3 million, mostly offset by tax payments of     $122.0 million and a tax benefit of stock options of     $32.5 million.         We expect continued growth in our expenditures, particularly     those related to research and development, clinical trials,     commercialization of new products, international expansion and     capital investments. However, we anticipate that existing cash     and cash equivalent balances and marketable securities available     for sale combined with cash generated from future net product     sales, will provide sufficient capital resources to fund our     normal operations for the foreseeable future.     Contractual     Obligations         The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of     December 31, 2010:                                                                                   Payment Due By Period                 Less Than                                    More than                              1 Year           1 to 3 Years           3 to 5 Years           5 Years           Total                 In thousands $                    Senior notes            $                      $                      $       500,000               $       750,000               $       1,250,000              Operating leases                36,679                   42,398                   29,117                   28,953                   137,147              Manufacturing facility note payable                4,388                   8,563                   8,563                   4,281                   25,795              Other contract commitments                164,216                   116,215                   59,577                   31,151                   371,159                                                                                                    Total            $       205,283               $       167,176               $       597,257               $       814,385               $       1,784,101                                                                                                   Senior Notes:  On October 7, 2010, we     issued a total of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior     notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal     amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2015 (the 2015     notes), $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of     3.95% Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 notes)     and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of     5.7% Senior Notes due 2040 (the 2040 notes and,     together with the 2015 notes and the 2020 notes, referred to     herein as the notes). The notes were issued at     99.854%, 99.745% and 99.813% of par, respectively, and the     discount will be amortized as additional interest expense over     the period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of     approximately $10.3 million have been recorded as debt     issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet and are     amortized as additional interest expense using the effective     interest rate method over the period from issuance through     maturity.     Operating leases:  We lease office and research     facilities under various operating lease agreements in the     United States and various international markets. The     non-cancelable lease terms for the operating leases expire at     various dates between 2010 and 2018 and include renewal options.     In general, we are also required to reimburse the lessors for     real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other     operating costs associated with the leases. For more information     on the major facilities that we occupy under lease arrangements     refer to Part I, Item 2, Properties of     this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     Manufacturing Facility Note Payable:  In     December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility and     certain other assets and liabilities from Siegfried Ltd. and     Siegfried Dienste AG (together referred to herein as Siegfried)     located in Zofingen, Switzerland. At December 31, 2010, the     fair value of our note payable to Siegfried approximated the     carrying value of the note of $25.0 million.         54    Table of Contents    Other Contract Commitments:  Other contract     commitments include $362.5 million in contractual     obligations related to product supply contracts. In addition, we     have committed to invest $20.0 million in an investment     fund over a ten-year period, which is callable at any time. On     December 31, 2010, our remaining investment commitment was     $8.0 million. For more information refer to Note 19 of     the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in     this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     Collaboration Arrangements:  Potential     milestone payments total approximately $3.8 billion,     including approximately $2.3 billion contingent on the     achievement of various research, development and regulatory     approval milestones and approximately $1.5 billion in     sales-based milestones.         We have entered into certain research and development     collaboration agreements, as identified in Note 18 of the     Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual     Report on     Form 10-K,     with third parties that include the funding of certain     development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with     the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the     achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory     and/or     commercial targets. Our obligation to fund these efforts is     contingent upon continued involvement in the programs     and/or the     lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance     of the programs. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the     future potential payments are inherently uncertain, and     accordingly no amounts have been recorded in our Consolidated     Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 contained in     this Annual Report on     Form 10-K.     New     Accounting Principles     New Accounting Pronouncements:  In October     2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued     Accounting Standard Update, or ASU,     No. 2009-13,     Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, or ASU     2009-13,     which amends existing revenue recognition accounting     pronouncements that are currently within the scope of FASB     Accounting Standards     Codificationtm,      or ASC, 605. This guidance eliminates the requirement to     establish the fair value of undelivered products and services     and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon     managements estimate of the selling price for an     undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the     fair value of that undelivered item. ASU     2009-13 is     effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or     materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after     June 15, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if     any, that the adoption of this amendment will have on our     consolidated financial statements.         In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU     No. 2010-06,     Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements,     or ASU     2010-06,     which amends ASC 820 to add new requirements for     disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2     and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and     settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU     2010-06 also     clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of     disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to     measure fair value. Further, ASU     2010-06     amends guidance on employers disclosures about     postretirement benefit plan assets under ASC 715 to require     that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by     major categories of assets. ASU     2010-06 was     effective for the first reporting period (including interim     periods) beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the     requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases,     sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will     be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,     2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early     adoption is permitted. The section of the amendment pertaining     to transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 was effective     for us beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption of this     section of the amendment did not have any impact on our     consolidated financial statements. The section of the amendment     pertaining to Level 3 measurements will be effective for us     beginning January 1, 2011. We are currently evaluating the     impact, if any, that the adoption of this amendment will have on     our consolidated financial statements.         In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU     No. 2010-17,     Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition, or ASU     2010-17, to     (1) limit the scope of this ASU to research or development     arrangements and (2) require that guidance in this ASU be     met for an entity to apply the milestone method (record the     milestone payment in its entirety in the period received).     However, the FASB clarified that, even if the requirements in     ASU 2010-17     are met, entities would not be precluded from making an     accounting policy election to apply another appropriate     accounting policy that results in the deferral of some portion     of the arrangement consideration. The guidance in ASU     2010-17 will     apply to milestones in both single-deliverable and     multiple-deliverable arrangements involving research or          55    Table of Contents        development transactions. ASU     2010-17 will     be effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those     fiscal years) beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early     application is permitted. Entities can apply this guidance     prospectively to milestones achieved after adoption. However,     retrospective application to all prior periods is also     permitted. The adoption of this accounting standard will not     have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.         In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU     No. 2010-27,     Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Pharmaceutical     Manufacturers, or ASU     2010-27. ASU     2010-27     provides guidance concerning the recognition and classification     of the new annual fee payable by branded prescription drug     manufactures and importers on branded prescription drugs which     was mandated under the U.S. Health Care Reform Act enacted     in the United States in March 2010. Under this new accounting     standard, the annual fee would be presented as a component of     operating expenses and recognized over the calendar year. Such     fees are payable using a straight-line method of allocation     unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar     year. This ASU is effective for calendar years beginning on or     after December 31, 2010. As this standard relates only to     classification, the adoption of this accounting standard will     not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.         In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU     No. 2010-29,     Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information,     or ASU     2010-29. ASU     2010-29     clarifies disclosure requirements to require public entities     that enter into business combinations that are material on an     individual or aggregate basis to disclose pro forma information     for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting     period, including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined     entity as though the acquisition date had been as of the     beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.     ASU 2010-29     is effective for material business combinations for which the     acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011 and early     adoption is permitted. We have chosen early adoption of ASU     2010-29 and     the pro forma information related to our acquisitions of Abraxis     and Gloucester complies with the provisions of this standard     (See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements     contained in this Annual Report on     Form 10-K).     Critical     Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting     Policies         A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to     the portrayal of our financial condition and results of     operation and requires managements most difficult,     subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need     to make estimates about the effect of matters that are     inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies     are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the     Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual     Report, we believe the following accounting estimates and     policies to be critical:     Revenue Recognition:  Revenue from the sale of     products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the     product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for     discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and     distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry     are provided for in the same period the related sales are     recorded. We record estimated reductions to revenue for     volume-based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial     sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for such volume-based     discounts and rebates are based on the sales terms, historical     experience and trend analysis.         We recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees     sales of our products or products using our technologies.     Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the     contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably     estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured. If royalties     cannot be reasonably estimated or collectibility of a royalty     amount is not reasonably assured, royalties are recognized as     revenue when the cash is received.     Gross to Net Sales Accruals:  We record gross     to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales     discounts, government rebates, and chargebacks and distributor     service fees.         REVLIMID®      is distributed in the United States primarily through contracted     pharmacies under the     RevAssist®      program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution     program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe and     appropriate distribution and use of     REVLIMID®.      Internationally,     REVLIMID®      is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution     programs tailored to meet local competent authorities     specifications to help ensure the products safe and     appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by     country and, depending upon the country and the design of the     risk-management program, the product may be sold through     hospitals or retail          56    Table of Contents        pharmacies.     THALOMID®      is distributed in the United States under our     S.T.E.P.S.®      program which we developed and is a proprietary comprehensive     education and risk-management distribution program with the     objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution     and use of     THALOMID®.      Internationally,     THALOMID®      is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution     programs tailored to meet local competent authorities     specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate     distribution and use of     THALOMID®.      These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the     country and the design of the risk-management program, the     product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.     VIDAZA®      and     ABRAXANE®      are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical     industry supply chain and are not subject to the same     risk-management distribution programs as     THALOMID®      and     REVLIMID®.          We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand     retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as     reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and     other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where     product is still being returned or inventory centralization and     rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains,     as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these     estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change     in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a     determination is made and revenues in that period could be     materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual     returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots,     that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are     analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on     open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are     monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any     changes from the historical trend rates are considered in     determining the current sales return allowance.     REVLIMID®      is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted     pharmacies, lending itself to tighter controls of inventory     quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in     lower returns activity to date.     THALOMID®      is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a     result, wholesalers do not stock the product.         Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to     customers.         Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due     to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties     under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate     accruals are generally based on historical payment data and     estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to     the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for     Medicaid and Medicare Services. Full year 2010 revenues were     negatively impacted by the U.S. Health Care Reform Act     which increased the Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and     extended that rebate to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We     utilized historical patient data to estimate the incremental     costs related to the Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. In     addition, certain international markets have     government-sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid     based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate     accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.         Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale     customers, GPOs and end-user customers, consistent with     pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and     fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from date of     sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale     based on the contracted rates and historical redemption rates.     Upon receipt of chargeback, due to the availability of product     and customer specific information on these programs, we then     establish a specific provision for fees or rebates based on the     specific terms of each agreement.         Chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between     product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower     government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered     under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee     accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the     wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health     care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military     Health System that provides civilian health benefits for     military personnel, military retirees and their dependents.     TRICARE rebate accruals are based on estimated Department of     Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.     Income Taxes:  We utilize the asset and     liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this     method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based     on the difference between the financial statement carrying     amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted     tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences     are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when     it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be     realized.         57    Table of Contents        We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax     positions as part of our provision for income taxes. These     unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common     among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a     variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include     studies performed by independent economists, advice from     industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken     by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing     authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide     estimates for unrecognized tax benefits. If our estimates are     not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations     could be materially impacted.         We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of     deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these     deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we     believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors     when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred     tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience     by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income,     carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes,     various income tax strategies and other relevant factors.     Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and,     to the extent future expectations change, we would have to     assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that     time. At December 31, 2010, it was more likely than not     that we would realize our deferred tax assets, net of valuation     allowances.     Share-Based Compensation:  The cost of     share-based compensation is recognized in the Consolidated     Statements of Operations based on the fair value of all awards     granted, using the Black-Scholes method of valuation. The fair     value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is     recognized over the service period required to obtain full     vesting. Compensation cost to be recognized reflects an estimate     of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into     consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual     experience.     Other-Than-Temporary     Impairments of     Available-For-Sale     Marketable Securities:  A decline in the market     value of any     available-for-sale     marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be     other-than-temporary     results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The     impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the     security established. The determination of whether an     available-for-sale     marketable security is     other-than-temporarily     impaired requires significant judgment and requires     consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence     in evaluating the potential impairment. Factors evaluated to     determine whether the investment is     other-than-temporarily     impaired include: significant deterioration in the issuers     earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business     prospects of the issuer, adverse changes in the general market     conditions in which the issuer operates, length of time that the     fair value has been below our cost, our expected future cash     flows from the security, our intent not to sell and an     evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will     not have to sell before recovery of our cost basis. Assumptions     associated with these factors are subject to future market and     economic conditions, which could differ from our assessment.     Derivatives and Hedging Activities:  All     derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at     their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative     instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or     other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a     derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging     transaction and, if it is, the type of hedging transaction. For     a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout     the hedged period, we formally document the nature and     relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item.     We assess, both at inception and on an on-going basis, whether     the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging     transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in     cash flows of hedged items. We assess hedge effectiveness on a     quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the     ineffective portion of derivative instruments, if any, to     current earnings. If we determine that a forecasted transaction     is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge     accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the     derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. We use     derivative instruments, including those not designated as part     of a hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to movements in     foreign exchange and interest rates. The use of these derivative     instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent     to reduce our risk or cost. We do not use derivative instruments     for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to     leveraged derivatives.     Investment in Affiliated Companies:  We apply     the equity method of accounting to our investment in common     stock of an affiliated company and certain investment funds,     which primarily invest in companies conducting business in life     sciences such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical     technology, medical devices, diagnostics and health and wellness.         58    Table of Contents        Equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible     impairment. If an investments fair value is determined to     be less than its net carrying value and the decline is     determined to be     other-than-temporary,     the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an     evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and     circumstances. Factors considered in determining whether an     other-than-temporary     decline in value has occurred include: market value or exit     price of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or     future rounds of financing by the investee; length of time that     the market value was below its cost basis; financial condition     and business prospects of the investee; our intent and ability     to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to     allow for recovery in market value of the investment; issues     that raise concerns about the investees ability to     continue as a going concern; and any other information that we     may be aware of related to the investment.     Accounting for Long-Term Incentive Plans:  We     have established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed     to provide key officers and executives with performance-based     incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of     pre-established corporate performance objectives covering a     three-year period. We currently have three three-year     performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31,     2011, 2012 and 2013. Performance measures for each LTIP are     based on the following components in the last year of the     three-year cycle: 25% on non-GAAP earnings per share, 25% on     non-GAAP net income and 50% on total non-GAAP revenue, as     defined.         Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the     participants salary for the plans. Awards are payable in     cash or, at our discretion, in our common stock based upon our     stock price at the payout date. We accrue the long-term     incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior to the end     of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of     our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in     control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment     equal to their target award, or an award based on actual     performance, if higher, through the date of the change in     control.         Accruals recorded for the LTIP entail making certain assumptions     concerning future non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP net     income and non-GAAP revenues, as defined; the actual results of     which could be materially different than the assumptions used.     Accruals for the LTIP are reviewed on a regular basis and     revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects     updated estimates of future payouts. In estimating the accruals,     management considers actual results to date for the performance     period, expected results for the remainder of the performance     period, operating trends, product development, pricing and     competition.     Valuation     of Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and     IPR&D:          We have recorded goodwill, acquired intangible assets and     IPR&D primarily through the acquisitions of Pharmion,     Gloucester and Abraxis. When identifiable intangible assets,     including in-process research and development, are acquired, we     determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition     date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these     valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the     models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions     including but not limited to:                         projecting regulatory approvals,                    estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from     completed products and in-process projects and                    developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates           Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value     of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for     by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized,     but subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a     triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential     impairment. We test our goodwill annually for impairment each     November 30. We are organized as a single reporting unit     and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our     overall market value, as determined by our traded share price,     as compared to our book value of net assets.         Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to     their estimated residual values over their estimated useful     lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur.     Intangible assets related to IPR&D product rights are     treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and not amortized     until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities     in specified markets. At that time, we will determine the useful     life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of          59    Table of Contents        IPR&D and begin amortization. Impairment testing is also     performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs     that could indicate a potential impairment. Our IPR&D     product rights were obtained in the Gloucester and Abraxis     acquisitions. The Gloucester related product rights will become     definite-lived intangibles when marketing approval is received     for     ISTODAX®      for treatment of PTCL in the United States and the European     Union. The Abraxis related product rights will become     definite-lived intangibles when marketing approval is received     for     ABRAXANE®      for treatment of either NSCLC, pancreatic cancer or melanoma in     a major market, typically either the United States or the     European Union, or in a series of other countries, subject to     certain specified conditions and management judgment.     Valuation     of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business     Combination:          We record contingent consideration resulting from a business     combination at its fair value on the acquisition date, and for     each subsequent reporting period revalue these obligations and     record increases or decreases in their fair value as an     adjustment to operating earnings in the consolidated statements     of operations. Changes to contingent consideration obligations     can result from movements in publicly traded share prices of     CVRs, adjustments to discount rates and periods, updates in the     assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones or     changes in the probability of certain clinical events and     changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory     approval. The assumptions related to determining the value of a     contingent consideration include a significant amount of     judgment and any changes in the assumptions could have a     material impact on the amount of contingent consideration     expense recorded in any given period. Our contingent     consideration liabilities were acquired in the acquisitions of     Gloucester and Abraxis. The fair value of the Gloucester     contingent consideration liability is based on the discount     rates, probabilities and estimated timing of two cash milestone     payments to the former Gloucester shareholders. The fair value     of the Abraxis contingent consideration liability is based on     the quoted market price of the publicly traded CVRs.           ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE     AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK           The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative     and qualitative information about our potential exposure to     market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising     from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The     risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse     changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.         We have established guidelines relative to the diversification     and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity.     These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified     depending on market conditions. Although investments may be     subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit     quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of     credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of     investment. At December 31, 2010, our market risk sensitive     instruments consisted of marketable securities available for     sale, our long-term debt, our note payable and certain foreign     currency forward contracts.     Marketable Securities Available for Sale:  At     December 31, 2010, our marketable securities available for     sale consisted of U.S. Treasury securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed     securities,     non-U.S. government,     agency and Supranational securities, global corporate debt     securities and marketable equity securities.     U.S. government-sponsored agency securities include general     unsecured obligations either issued directly by or guaranteed by     U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises.     U.S. government-sponsored agency MBS include mortgage     backed securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage     Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the     Government National Mortgage Association.     Non-U.S. government,     agency and Supranational securities, consist of direct     obligations of highly rated governments of nations other than     the United States, obligations of sponsored agencies and other     entities that are guaranteed or supported by highly rated     governments of nations other than the United States. Corporate     debt  global includes obligations issued by     investment-grade corporations including some issues that have     been guaranteed by governments and government agencies.         Marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair     value, held for an unspecified period of time and are intended     for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains     and losses on     available-for-sale     securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a     separate component of stockholders equity,          60    Table of Contents        net of tax. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for     amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.     The amortization, along with realized gains and losses and other     than temporary impairment charges, is included in interest and     investment income, net.         As of December 31, 2010, the principal amounts, fair values     and related weighted-average interest rates of our investments     in debt securities classified as marketable securities available     for sale were as follows:                                                                                   Duration             Less than                        More than                      1 Year       1 to 3 Years       3 to 5 Years       5 Years       Total             In thousands $                Principal amount            $       435,227               $       742,537               $       38,994               $       12,401               $       1,229,159              Fair value            $       438,813               $       755,827               $       38,490               $       12,774               $       1,245,904              Average interest rate                0.5       %               1.0       %               3.7       %               2.6       %               0.9       %         Long-Term Debt:  On October 7, 2010, we     issued a total of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior     notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal     amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2015, $500.0 million     aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due 2020     and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of     5.7% Senior Notes due 2040. The notes were issued at     99.854%, 99.745% and 99.813% of par, respectively, and the     discount amortized as additional interest expense over the     period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of     approximately $10.3 million have been recorded as debt     issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet and are     amortized as additional interest expense using the effective     interest rate method over the period from issuance through     maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in     arrears on April 15 and October 15 each year beginning     April 15, 2011 and the principal on each note is due in     full at their respective maturity dates. The notes may be     redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time at a     redemption price defined in a make-whole clause equaling accrued     and unpaid interest plus the greater of 100% of the principal     amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present     values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and     principal. If we experience a change of control accompanied by a     downgrade of the debt to below investment grade, we will be     required to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price     equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid     interest. We are subject to covenants which limit our ability to     pledge properties as security under borrowing arrangements and     limit our ability to perform sale and leaseback transactions     involving our property. At December 31, 2010, the fair     value of our senior notes outstanding was $1.197 billion.     Note Payable:  In December 2006, we purchased     an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing     facility and certain other assets and liabilities from     Siegfried. At December 31, 2010, the fair value of our note     payable to Siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note     of $25.0 million. Assuming other factors are held constant,     an increase in interest rates generally will result in a     decrease in the fair value of the note. The note is denominated     in Swiss francs and its fair value will also be affected by     changes in the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate. The     carrying value of the note reflects the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc     exchange rate and Swiss interest rates.     Foreign Currency Forward Contracts:  We use     foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted     transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to reduce     exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and     liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.         We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect     against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash flows     resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates,     primarily associated with non-functional currency denominated     revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries. The foreign     currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 had settlement dates within     36 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are     designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815 and,     accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or     losses on them are reported in other comprehensive income     (loss), or OCI, and reclassified to operations in the same     periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect     operations.          61    Table of Contents        Any ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts     is reported in other income, net. Foreign currency forward     contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses     were as follows:                                               Notional Amount                 December 31,         Foreign Currency       2010           2009                 In thousands $                    British Pound            $       58,440               $                     Canadian Dollar                133,128                                 Euro                675,438                   1,107,340              Japanese Yen                632,962                                 Swiss Franc                77,669                                 Others                54,644                                                                       Total            $       1,632,281               $       1,107,340                                                       We consider the impact of our own and the counterparties     credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the     ability of each party to execute its obligations under the     contract. As of December 31, 2010, credit risk did not     materially change the fair value of our foreign currency forward     contracts.         We recognized an increase in net product sales for certain     effective cash flow hedge instruments of $47.7 million for     2010 and a reduction in net product sales of $36.4 million     for 2009. These settlements were recorded in the same period as     the related forecasted sales occurred. We recognized a decrease     in other income, net for the settlement of certain effective     cash flow hedge instruments of $0.1 million for 2010     compared to an increase of $6.5 million for 2009. These     settlements were recorded in the same period as the related     forecasted expenses occurred. Changes in time value, which we     excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, were included     in other income, net.         We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce     exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain recognized     assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These     foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as     hedges under ASC 815 and, accordingly, any changes in their     fair value are recognized in other income, net in the current     period. The aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency     forward non-designated hedging contracts outstanding at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $848.6 million and     $483.2 million, respectively.         Although not predictive in nature, we believe a hypothetical 10%     threshold reflects a reasonably possible near-term change in     foreign currency rates. Assuming that the December 31, 2010     exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical 10%, the fair     value of the foreign currency forward contracts would change by     approximately $259.0 million. However, since the contracts     either hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions     denominated in foreign currencies or relate to assets and     liabilities denominated in currencies other than the     entities functional currencies, any change in the fair     value of the contract would be either reported in other     comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same     periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect     earnings or remeasured through earnings each period along with     the underlying asset or liability.         On February 23, 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap     contract to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure from     fixed rate to floating rate to more closely align interest     expense with interest income received on its cash equivalent and     investment balances. The floating rate is benchmarked to LIBOR.     The swap is designated as a fair value hedge on the fixed-rate     debt issue maturing October 2015. Since the specific terms and     notional amount of the swap match those of the debt being     hedged, it is assumed to be a highly effective hedge and all     changes in fair value of the swaps will be recorded on the     Consolidated Balance Sheets with no net impact recorded in the     Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of this filing, the     total notional amount of debt hedged with an interest rate swap     is $125.0 million.         62               ITEM 8.

In connection with our audits of the     consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the     consolidated financial statement schedule,     Schedule II  Valuation and Qualifying     Accounts. These consolidated financial statements and     consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility     of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to     express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements     and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our     audits.         We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are     free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a     test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in     the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, as well as evaluating the overall financial     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a     reasonable basis for our opinion.         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred     to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial     position of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries as of     December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their     operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the     three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity     with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,     in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement     schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated     financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all     material respects, the information set forth therein.         As discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial     statements, the Company has, as of January 1, 2009, changed     its method of accounting for business combinations and, as of     January 1, 2008, changed its method of accounting for the     measurement of the fair value of financial assets and     liabilities, each due to the adoption of new accounting     requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.         We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the     effectiveness of the Companys internal control over     financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on     criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of     the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28,     2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of     the Companys internal control over financial reporting.     This report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that     management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of     the Companys internal control over financial reporting as     of December 31, 2010, the internal control over financial     reporting of Abraxis BioScience, Inc. associated with total net     assets of approximately $3.2 billion (of which     approximately $2.6 billion represents goodwill and     identifiable intangible assets which are included within the     scope of the assessment) as of December 31, 2010 and total     revenue of $88.5 million for the year ended     December 31, 2010.     /s/  KPMG     LLP         Short Hills, New Jersey       February 28, 2011         64    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Thousands of dollars, except per share amounts, unless     otherwise indicated)            1.     Nature of     Business and Basis and Summary of Significant Accounting     Policies            Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively     Celgene or the Company) is a global     biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery,     development and commercialization of innovative therapies     designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. The     Company is dedicated to innovative research and development     which is designed to bring new therapies to market and is     involved in research in several scientific areas that may     deliver proprietary next-generation therapies, targeting areas     such as intracellular signaling pathways in cancer and immune     cells, immunomodulation in cancer and autoimmunity and placental     cell, including stem and progenitor cell, research.         The Companys primary commercial stage products include     REVLIMID®,      VIDAZA®,      THALOMID®      (inclusive of Thalidomide     Celgene®      and Thalidomide     Pharmion®),      ABRAXANE®      which was obtained in the October 2010 acquisition of Abraxis     BioScience, Inc., or Abraxis, and     ISTODAX®,      which was obtained in the January 2010 acquisition of Gloucester     Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Gloucester (See Note 2).     Additional sources of revenue include sales of     FOCALIN®      exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, a licensing     agreement with Novartis, which entitles the Company to royalties     on FOCALIN     XR®      and the entire     RITALIN®      family of drugs, residual payments from GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK,     based upon GSKs     ALKERAN®      revenues through the end of March 2011, sale of services through     the Companys Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary and other     miscellaneous licensing agreements.         The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of     Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries, including certain     former Abraxis entities determined to be non-core to the Company     and reported as assets held for sale and liabilities of disposal     group on the consolidated balance sheet. Investments in limited     partnerships and interests where the Company has an equity     interest of 50% or less and does not otherwise have a     controlling financial interest are accounted for by either the     equity or cost method. The Company records net income (loss)     attributable to non-controlling interest in its Consolidated     Statements of Operations equal to the percentage of ownership     interest retained in the respective operations by the     non-controlling parties.         The preparation of the consolidated financial statements     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that     affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could     differ from those estimates. The Company is subject to certain     risks and uncertainties related to product development,     regulatory approval, market acceptance, scope of patent and     proprietary rights, competition, technological change and     product liability.      Financial Instruments:  Certain financial     instruments reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, (e.g.,     cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain other     assets, accounts payable and certain other liabilities) are     recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their     short-term nature. The fair values of financial instruments     other than marketable securities are determined through a     combination of management estimates and information obtained     from third parties using the latest market data. The fair value     of     available-for-sale     marketable securities is determined utilizing the valuation     techniques appropriate to the type of security (See Note 5).       Derivative Instruments and Hedges:  All     derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at     their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative     instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or     other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a     derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging     transaction and, if it is, the type of hedging transaction. For     a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout     the hedged period, the Company formally documents the nature and     relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item.     The Company assesses, both at inception and on an on-going     basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash     flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the     changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company assesses     hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and records the gain     or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative     instruments, if any, to current earnings. If the Company     determines that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable     of occurring, it discontinues hedge accounting and any related     unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is     recognized in current earnings. The Company uses derivative     instruments, including those not designated as part of a hedging     transaction, to manage its exposure to          69    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          movements in foreign exchange and interest rates. The use of     these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these     risks with the intent to reduce the Companys risk or cost.     The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative     trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.       Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available     for Sale:  The Company invests its excess cash     primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed     securities,     non-U.S. government,     agency and Supranational securities and global corporate debt     securities. All liquid investments with maturities of three     months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash     equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than     three months from date of purchase are classified as marketable     securities available for sale. The Company determines the     appropriate classification of its investments in marketable debt     and equity securities at the time of purchase. Marketable     securities available for sale are carried at fair value, held     for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in     meeting the Companys ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized     gains and losses on     available-for-sale     securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a     separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax. The     cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums     and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along     with realized gains and losses and other than temporary     impairment charges, is included in interest and investment     income, net.         A decline in the market value of any     available-for-sale     security below its carrying value that is determined to be     other-than-temporary     would result in a charge to earnings and decrease in the     securitys carrying value down to its newly established     fair value. Factors evaluated to determine if an investment is     other-than-temporarily     impaired include significant deterioration in earnings     performance, credit rating, asset quality or business prospects     of the issuer; adverse changes in the general market condition     in which the issuer operates; the Companys intent to hold     to maturity and an evaluation as to whether it is more likely     than not that the Company will not have to sell before recovery     of its cost basis; and issues that raise concerns about the     issuers ability to continue as a going concern.       Concentration of Credit Risk:  Cash, cash     equivalents and marketable securities are financial instruments     that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit     risk. The Company invests its excess cash primarily in money     market funds, U.S. Treasury fixed rate securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency fixed rate securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed fixed rate     securities and FDIC guaranteed fixed rate corporate debt,     non-U.S. government     issued securities and     non-U.S. government     guaranteed securities (See Note 7). The Company may also     invest in unrated or below investment grade securities, such as     equity in private companies. The Company has established     guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to     maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed     periodically and may be modified to take advantage of trends in     yields and interest rates.          The Company sells its products in the United States primarily     through wholesale distributors and specialty contracted     pharmacies. Therefore, wholesale distributors and large pharmacy     chains account for a large portion of the Companys     U.S. trade receivables and net product revenues (See     Note 20). International sales are primarily made directly     to hospitals, clinics and retail chains, many of which in Europe     are government owned and have extended their payment terms in     recent years given the economic pressure these countries are     facing. The Company continuously monitors the creditworthiness     of its customers, including these governments, and has internal     policies regarding customer credit limits. The Company also     continues to monitor economic conditions, including the     volatility associated with international sovereign economies,     associated impacts on the financial markets and its business and     the sovereign debt crisis in certain European countries. The     Company believes the credit and economic conditions within     Spain, Italy and Portugal, among other members of the European     Union, have deteriorated during 2010. Total net receivables in     these three countries amounted to $231.6 million at     December 31, 2010. These conditions, as well as inherent     variability of timing of cash receipts, have resulted in, and     may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of     time that it takes to collect on the accounts receivable     outstanding in these countries. The Company estimates an     allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the credit     worthiness of its customers, historical payment patterns, aging     of receivable balances and general economic conditions.         70    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)       Inventory:  Inventories are recorded at the     lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a     first-in,     first-out basis. The Company periodically reviews the     composition of inventory in order to identify obsolete,     slow-moving or otherwise non-saleable items. If non-saleable     items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the     inventory, the Company will record a write-down to net     realizable value in the period that the decline in value is     first recognized. Included in inventory are raw materials used     in the production of preclinical and clinical products, which     are charged to research and development expense when consumed.       Assets Held for Sale:  Assets to be disposed of     are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and     reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value     less costs to sell, and are not depreciated. The assets and     related liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for     sale are presented separately in the current asset and current     liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet.       Property, Plant and Equipment:  Property, plant     and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.     Depreciation of plant and equipment is recorded using the     straight-line method. Building improvements are depreciated over     the remaining useful life of the building. Leasehold     improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the economic     useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease,     including anticipated renewal options. The estimated useful     lives of capitalized assets are as follows:                                  Buildings                40 years              Building and operating equipment                15 years              Manufacturing machinery and equipment                10 years              Other machinery and equipment                5 years              Furniture and fixtures                5 years              Computer equipment and software                3-7 years                   Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred,     while expenditures for improvements which extend the life of an     asset are capitalized.      Capitalized Software Costs:  The Company     capitalizes software costs incurred in connection with     developing or obtaining software. Capitalized software costs are     included in property, plant and equipment, net and are amortized     over their estimated useful life of three to seven years from     the date the systems are ready for their intended use.       Investment in Affiliated Companies:  The     Company applies the equity method of accounting to its     investments in common stock of affiliated companies and certain     investment funds, which primarily invest in companies conducting     business in life sciences such as biotechnology,     pharmaceuticals, medical technology, medical devices,     diagnostics and health and wellness. Equity method investments     obtained through the acquisition of former Abraxis have been     determined to be non-core activities and are classified as     assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet.          Equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible     impairment. If an investments fair value is determined to     be less than its net carrying value and the decline is     determined to be     other-than-temporary,     the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an     evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and     circumstances. Factors considered in determining whether an     other-than-temporary     decline in value has occurred include: market value or exit     price of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or     future rounds of financing by the investee; length of time that     the market value was below its cost basis; financial condition     and business prospects of the investee; the Companys     intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient     period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the     investment; issues that raise concerns about the investees     ability to continue as a going concern; any other information     that the Company may be aware of related to the investment.      Other Intangible Assets:  Intangible assets     with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated     residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed     for impairment if certain events occur as described in     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets below. Intangible     assets which are not amortized include acquired in-process          71    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          research and development, or IPR&D, and acquired intangible     assets held for sale. Amortization is initiated for IPR&D     intangible assets when their useful lives have been determined.     IPR&D intangible assets which are determined to have had a     drop in their fair value, are adjusted downward through the     earnings statement. These are tested at least annually or when a     triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential     impairment.       Goodwill:  Goodwill represents the excess of     purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a     business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of     accounting and is not amortized, but subject to impairment     testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that     could indicate a potential impairment. The Company tests its     goodwill annually for impairment each November 30.       Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:  Long-lived     assets, such as property, plant and equipment are reviewed for     impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate     that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.         Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a     comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to     the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be     generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of     the assets exceed their estimated future undiscounted net cash     flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which     the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the     assets.       Foreign Currency Translation:  Operations in     non-U.S. entities     are recorded in the functional currency of each entity. For     financial reporting purposes, the functional currency of an     entity is determined by a review of the source of an     entitys most predominant cash flows. Effective     January 1, 2010, the Company changed the functional     currency of Celgene International Sarl from the Euro to the     U.S. Dollar. Significant changes in economic facts and     circumstances supported this change in functional currency and     the change was applied on a prospective basis. The results of     operations for     non-U.S. dollar     functional currency entities are translated from functional     currencies into U.S. dollars using the average currency     rate during each month, which approximates the results that     would be obtained using actual currency rates on the dates of     individual transactions. Assets and liabilities are translated     using currency rates at the end of the period. Adjustments     resulting from translating the financial statements of the     Companys foreign entities into the U.S. dollar are     excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded     as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction     gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in     the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had net     foreign exchange losses of $9.8 million in 2010 and gains     of $54.5 million and $4.7 million in 2009 and 2008,     respectively.       Research and Development Costs:  Research and     development costs are expensed as incurred. These include all     internal and external costs related to services contracted by     the Company. Upfront and milestone payments made to third     parties in connection with research and development     collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of     regulatory approval. Milestone payments made to third parties     subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized     over the remaining useful life of the related product.       Income Taxes:  The Company utilizes the asset     and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this     method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based     on the difference between the financial statement carrying     amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted     tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences     are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when     it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a     deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes     the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or     expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax     position is more likely than not to be sustained.       Revenue Recognition:  Revenue from the sale of     products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the     product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for     discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and     distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry     are provided for in the same period the related sales are     recorded.         Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to     customers.         72    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due     to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties     under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate     accruals are generally based on historical payment data and     estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to     the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for     Medicaid and Medicare Services. The Company utilized historical     patient data to estimate the incremental costs related to the     Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. In addition, certain     international markets have government-sponsored programs that     require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and,     accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on     estimated eligible sales.         Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale     customers, GPOs and end-user customers, consistent with     pharmaceutical industry practices. The Company provides a     provision for rebates at the time of sale based on the     contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Upon receipt     of chargeback, due to the availability of product and customer     specific information on these programs, the Company then     establishes a specific provision for fees or rebates based on     the specific terms of each agreement.         The Company bases its sales returns allowance on estimated     on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer     demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns     history and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots     where product is still being returned or inventory     centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by     major pharmacy chains. If the historical data used by the     Company to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect     future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in     the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in     that period could be materially affected. Under this     methodology, the Company tracks actual returns by individual     production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer     eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine     historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is,     lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and     compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from     the historical trend rates are considered in determining the     current sales return allowance.         Chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between     product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower     government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered     under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee     accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the     wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health     care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military     Health System that provides civilian health benefits for     military personnel, military retirees and their dependents.     TRICARE rebate accruals are based on estimated Department of     Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.         The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for free     goods and volume-based discounts at the time of the initial     sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for such free goods     and volume-based discounts are based on the sales terms,     historical experience and trend analysis. The cost of free goods     is included in Cost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of     acquired intangible assets).         The Company recognizes revenue from royalties based on     licensees sales of its products or products using its     technologies. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance     with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be     reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured.     If royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectibility of     a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, royalties are     recognized as revenue when the cash is received.       Share-Based Compensation:  The cost of     share-based compensation is recognized in the Consolidated     Statements of Operations based on the fair value of all awards     granted, using the Black-Scholes method of valuation. The fair     value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is     recognized over the service period required to obtain full     vesting. Compensation cost to be recognized reflects an estimate     of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into     consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual     experience.       Earnings Per Share:  Basic earnings per share     is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average     number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted     earnings per share is computed by dividing net income adjusted     to add back the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the     period associated with any convertible debt issuance that may be     dilutive by the weighted-average number of common shares     outstanding          73    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          during the period increased to include all additional common     shares that would have been outstanding as if the outstanding     convertible debt was converted into shares of common stock and     assuming potentially dilutive common shares, resulting from     option exercises, restricted stock units, warrants and other     incentives had been issued and any proceeds thereof used to     repurchase common stock at the average market price during the     period. The assumed proceeds used to repurchase common stock is     the sum of the amount to be paid to the Company upon exercise of     options, the amount of compensation cost attributed to future     services and not yet recognized and, if applicable, the amount     of excess income tax benefit that would be credited to paid-in     capital upon exercise. As of their maturity date, June 1,     2008, substantially all of the Companys convertible notes     were converted into shares of common stock.       Comprehensive Income:  The components of     comprehensive income (loss) consist of net income (loss),     changes in pension liability, changes in net unrealized gains     (losses) on marketable securities classified as     available-for-sale,     net unrealized gains (losses) related to cash flow hedges and     changes in foreign currency translation adjustments, which     includes changes in a subsidiarys functional currency and     net asset transfers of common control subsidiaries.           A summary of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net     of tax, is summarized as follows:                                                                                                                                   Total                              Net Unrealized                        Foreign            Accumulated                              Gains (Losses) from            Net Unrealized            Currency            Other                  Pension            Marketable            Gains (Losses)            Translation            Comprehensive                  Liability           Securities           From Hedges           Adjustment           Income (Loss)                    Balance December 31, 2008            $       (3,321       )           $       16,583               $       (50,117       )           $       (90,689       )           $       (127,544       )          Period Change                5,180                   (16,371       )               55,479                   (6,169       )               38,119                                                                                                    Balance December 31, 2009                1,859                   212                   5,362                   (96,858       )               (89,425       )          Period Change                (5,695       )               2,890                   (20,918       )               39,381                   15,658                                                                                                    Balance December 31, 2010            $       (3,836       )           $       3,102               $       (15,556       )           $       (57,477       )           $       (73,767       )                                                                                                                                                                                       New Accounting Pronouncements:  In October     2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued     Accounting Standard Update, or ASU,     No. 2009-13,     Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, or ASU     2009-13,     which amends existing revenue recognition accounting     pronouncements that are currently within the scope of FASB     Accounting Standards     Codificationtm,      or ASC, 605. This guidance eliminates the requirement to     establish the fair value of undelivered products and services     and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon     managements estimate of the selling price for an     undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the     fair value of that undelivered item. ASU     2009-13 is     effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or     materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after     June 15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the     impact, if any, that the adoption of this amendment will have on     its consolidated financial statements.           In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU     No. 2010-06,     Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements,     or ASU     2010-06,     which amends ASC 820 to add new requirements for     disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2     and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and     settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU     2010-06 also     clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of     disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to     measure fair value. Further, ASU     2010-06     amends guidance on employers disclosures about     post-retirement benefit plan assets under ASC 715 to     require that disclosures be provided by classes of assets     instead of by major categories of assets. ASU     2010-06 was     effective for the first reporting period (including interim     periods) beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the     requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases,     sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will     be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,     2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early     adoption is permitted. The section of the amendment pertaining     to transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 was effective     for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption of     this section of the amendment did not have any impact on          74    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          the Companys consolidated financial statements. The     section of the amendment pertaining to Level 3 measurements     will be effective for the Company beginning January 1,     2011. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any,     that the adoption of this amendment will have on its     consolidated financial statements.           In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU     No. 2010-17,     Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition, or ASU     2010-17, to     (1) limit the scope of this ASU to research or development     arrangements and (2) require that guidance in this ASU be     met for an entity to apply the milestone method (record the     milestone payment in its entirety in the period received).     However, the FASB clarified that, even if the requirements in     ASU 2010-17     are met, entities would not be precluded from making an     accounting policy election to apply another appropriate     accounting policy that results in the deferral of some portion     of the arrangement consideration. The guidance in ASU     2010-17 will     apply to milestones in both single-deliverable and     multiple-deliverable arrangements involving research or     development transactions. ASU     2010-17 will     be effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those     fiscal years) beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early     application is permitted. Entities can apply this guidance     prospectively to milestones achieved after adoption. However,     retrospective application to all prior periods is also     permitted. The adoption of this accounting standard will not     have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial     statements.           In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU     No. 2010-27,     Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Pharmaceutical     Manufacturers, or ASU     2010-27. ASU     2010-27     provides guidance concerning the recognition and classification     of the new annual fee payable by branded prescription drug     manufactures and importers on branded prescription drugs which     was mandated under the U.S. Health Care Reform Act enacted     in the United States in March 2010. Under this new accounting     standard, the annual fee would be presented as a component of     operating expenses and recognized over the calendar year. Such     fees are payable using a straight-line method of allocation     unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar     year. This ASU is effective for calendar years beginning on or     after December 31, 2010. As this standard relates only to     classification, the adoption of this accounting standard will     not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial     statements.           In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU     No. 2010-29,     Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information,     or ASU     2010-29. ASU     2010-29     clarifies disclosure requirements to require public entities     that enter into business combinations that are material on an     individual or aggregate basis to disclose pro forma information     for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting     period, including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined     entity as though the acquisition date had been as of the     beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.     ASU 2010-29     is effective for material business combinations for which the     acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011 and early     adoption is permitted. The Company has chosen early adoption of     ASU 2010-29     and the pro forma information related to the acquisitions of     Abraxis and Gloucester complies with the provisions of this     standard (See Note 2).             2.     Acquisitions        Abraxis     BioScience, Inc.         On October 15, 2010, or the Acquisition Date, the Company     acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abraxis     BioScience, Inc., or Abraxis. The transaction, referred to as     the Merger, resulted in Abraxis becoming a wholly owned     subsidiary of the Company. The results of operations for Abraxis     are included in the Companys consolidated financial     statements from the date of acquisition and the assets and     liabilities of Abraxis have been recorded at their respective     fair values on the acquisition date and consolidated with those     of the Company.         Prior to the Merger, Abraxis was a fully integrated global     biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery, development     and delivery of next-generation therapeutics and core     technologies that offer patients treatments for cancer and other     critical illnesses. Abraxis portfolio includes an oncology     compound,     ABRAXANE®,      which is based on Abraxis proprietary tumor-targeting     platform known as     nab®      technology.     ABRAXANE®,      the first FDA approved product to use the     nab®      technology, was launched in 2005 for the treatment of metastatic     breast cancer.          75    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          Abraxis has continued to expand the     nab®      technology through a clinical program and a product pipeline     containing a number of     nab®      technology products in development. The acquisition of Abraxis     accelerates the Companys strategy to become a global     leader in oncology by adding the     nab®      technology and     ABRAXANE®      to the technology and product portfolios of the Company.         Each share of Abraxis common stock outstanding, other than     treasury shares of Abraxis, was cancelled and the holder     received (i) $58.00 in cash, (ii) 0.2617 of a share of     the Companys common stock and (iii) one contingent     value right, or CVR, issued by the Company. Stock options     belonging to employees were cancelled in exchange for one CVR     plus a cash payment amounting to the sum of $58.00 in cash plus     the equivalent value of one share of Celgene common stock less     the exercise price of each option. As discussed further in the     section entitled Contingent Value Rights below, a     holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a pro rata portion of     cash payments that the Company is obligated to pay to all     holders of CVRs, which is determined by achievement of certain     net sales and U.S. regulatory approval milestones.     Potential cash payments to CVR holders ranges from no payment if     no regulatory milestones are met, to a maximum of     $650 million in milestone payments plus payments based on     annual net sales levels achieved if all milestones are met at     the earliest target dates and sales exceed threshold amounts. A     total of approximately $2.363 billion in cash was paid and     10,660,196 shares of the Companys common stock and     43,273,855 CVRs were issued as consideration for the Merger.         The table below lists the fair value of consideration     transferred in the Merger:                                    Fair Value at the                  Acquisition Date                    Cash            $       2,362,633              Celgene common stock(1)                617,758              Contingent value rights(2)                225,024                                    Total fair value of consideration transferred            $       3,205,415                                                 (1)        Issued 10,660,196 shares of the Companys Common Stock     on October 15, 2010 with a fair value of $57.95 per share     based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on     the day before the Acquisition Date.          (2)        Issued 43,273,855 CVRs valued at $5.20 per CVR based on the     closing price on the Acquisition Date.           The Merger has been accounted for using the acquisition method     of accounting which requires that most assets acquired and     liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the     acquisition date and requires the fair value of acquired     in-process research and development to be classified as     indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or     abandonment of the associated research and development efforts.     A preliminary purchase price allocation has been made and the     recorded amounts are subject to change.

The purchase of Abraxis included a number of assets that are not     associated with the     nab®      technology or     ABRAXANE®.      These assets, or non-core assets, include a number of     subsidiaries, tangible assets, equity investments, joint venture     partnerships and assets that support research and sales of     products not related to the     nab®      technology. The Company has committed to a plan to divest these     non-core assets and they are classified as assets held for sale     on the consolidated balance sheet and the associated liabilities     have been classified as liabilities of disposal group.         The fair values of current assets and current liabilities were     determined to approximate their book values while the fair value     of inventory was determined to be greater than book value and     the fair value of property plant and equipment not attributable     to non-core assets was determined to be greater than book value.     The fair value of current assets acquired includes trade     receivables of $58.4 million, of which $13.0 million     is attributable to non-core subsidiaries and included in assets     held for sale. The gross amount due is $61.1 million, of     which $2.7 million is expected to be uncollectible.         77    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          The amounts recorded for the major components of acquired     identifiable intangible assets are as follows:                                                            Amounts                                          Recognized            Weighted-                              as of            Average                              Acquisition            Useful Lives                              Date           (Years)                                Developed product rights            $       1,170,000                   17                              Other finite lived intangible assets                97,466                   14                              In-process research and development product rights                1,290,000                                                                                                       Total identifiable intangible assets            $       2,557,466                                                                                                        The fair value of the developed product rights asset was based     on expected cash flows from developed product right sales of     ABRAXANE®,      a nanoparticle, albumin-bound paclitaxel that was approved by     the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in January     2005, based on a 505(b)(2) submission, for the treatment of     metastatic breast cancer and, as of December 2010, was approved     for marketing in 42 countries. The fair value of the developed     product rights asset was derived using an income approach and     will be amortized over its expected useful life of 17 years.         Other finite-lived intangible assets include the fair value of     licensing contract rights, non-compete agreements and future     compassionate use sales.         The IPR&D product right asset was assigned a fair value of     $1.290 billion based on probability-weighted net cash flows     associated with future     ABRAXANE®      approval for indications to treat non-small cell lung cancer, or     NSCLC, pancreatic cancer and melanoma. The fair value     calculation used a risk-adjusted discount rate of 19% and the     following anticipated regulatory approval dates:                                           Anticipated      Indication       Region       Approval Timing                Non-small cell lung cancer            United States           Early 2012          Pancreatic cancer            United States           Mid-2014          Pancreatic cancer            European Union           Late 2015          Melanoma            United States           Late 2013          Melanoma            European Union           Late 2014             Acquired IPR&D will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived     intangible asset until regulatory approval in specified markets     or discontinuation.         The fair value of assumed contingent liabilities were included     based on managements assessment of probable outcomes of     litigation involving Abraxis initiated prior to the Merger. The     fair value assigned to assumed contingent liabilities amounts to     the present value of estimated future cash flows related to such     litigation.         The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts     assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed     represents the goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition.     The goodwill recorded as part of the Merger is largely     attributable to synergies expected to result from combining the     operations of Abraxis and the Company and intangible assets that     do not qualify for separate recognition. The Company does not     expect any portion of this goodwill to be deductible for tax     purposes. The goodwill attributable to the Merger has been     recorded as a noncurrent asset in its Consolidated Balance     Sheets and is not amortized, but is subject to review for     impairment annually.         Amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests have been     recorded to reflect the fair value of the portion of assets and     liabilities assumed at the acquisition date that are     attributable to noncontrolling interest owners of certain     acquired consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned.         78    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          Abraxis contributed net revenues of $88.5 million and     losses of $43.0 million, after consideration of     non-controlling interest, for the period from the acquisition     date through December 31, 2010.     Contingent     Value Rights         In connection with the Merger on October 15, 2010, CVRs     were issued under a CVR agreement entered into by Celgene and     American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the     trustee. A copy of the CVR agreement was filed on     Form 8-A     with the SEC on October 15, 2010. The CVRs are registered     for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol     CELGZ. The fair value of the CVRs and the liability     of the Company related to payments under the CVR agreement is     subject to fluctuation based on trading prices for the publicly     traded CVRs. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company has     measured the contingent consideration represented by the CVRs at     fair value with changes in fair value recognized in operating     earnings. At December 31, 2010, the balance of the CVR     related liability was $212.0 million and is included in     other non-current liabilities.         Each holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a pro rata     portion, based on the number of CVRs then outstanding, of     each of the following contingent cash payments:                     Milestone Payment #1.  $250 million     upon FDA approval of     ABRAXANE®      for use in the treatment of NSCLC, which approval permits the     Company to market     ABRAXANE®      under a label that includes a progression free survival claim,     but only if the foregoing milestone is achieved no later than     the fifth anniversary of the Merger.                Milestone Payment #2.  $400 million     (if achieved no later than April 1, 2013) or     $300 million (if achieved after April 1, 2013 and     before the fifth anniversary of the Merger) upon FDA approval of     ABRAXANE®      for use in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, which approval     permits the Company to market     ABRAXANE®      under a label that includes an overall survival claim.                Net Sales Payments.  For each full one-year     period ending December 31st during the term of the CVR     agreement, which we refer to as a net sales measuring period     (with the first net sales measuring period beginning     January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2011):                           2.5% of the net sales of     ABRAXANE®      and the Abraxis pipeline products that exceed $1 billion     but are less than or equal to $2 billion for such period,     plus                    an additional amount equal to 5% of the net sales of     ABRAXANE®      and the Abraxis pipeline products that exceed $2 billion     but are less than or equal to $3 billion for such period,     plus                    an additional amount equal to 10% of the net sales of     ABRAXANE®      and the Abraxis pipeline products that exceed $3 billion     for such period.           No payments will be due under the CVR agreement with respect to     net sales of     ABRAXANE®      and the Abraxis pipeline products achieved after     December 31, 2025, which we refer to as the net sales     payment termination date, unless net sales for the net sales     measuring period ending on December 31, 2025 are equal to     or greater than $1 billion, in which case the net sales     payment termination date will be extended until the last day of     the net sales measuring period subsequent to December 31,     2025 during which net sales of     ABRAXANE®      and the Abraxis pipeline products are less than $1 billion     or, if earlier, December 31, 2030.         The Company may, at any time on and after the date that 50% of     the CVRs issued pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement     either are no longer outstanding,     and/or     repurchased, acquired, redeemed or retired by the Company,     redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding CVRs at a     cash redemption price equal to the average price per CVR paid     for all CVRs by the Company in prior transactions.         The CVRs are unsecured obligations of the Company, subordinated     to an unlimited amount of the Companys senior obligations.         79    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)      Gloucester     Pharmaceuticals, Inc.         On January 15, 2010, the Company acquired all of the     outstanding common stock and stock options of Gloucester. The     assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Gloucester were     recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair     values, and consolidated with those of the Company. The reported     consolidated financial condition and results of operations of     the Company after completion of the acquisition reflect these     fair values. Gloucesters results of operations are     included in the Companys consolidated financial statements     from the date of acquisition. Gloucester contributed net     revenues of $15.8 million and losses of $50.3 million     for the period from the acquisition date through     December 31, 2010.         The Company paid $338.9 million in cash before milestone     payments and may make additional future payments of     $300.0 million in contingent regulatory milestone payments.     Prior to the acquisition, Gloucester was a privately held     biopharmaceutical company that acquired clinical-stage oncology     drug candidates with the goal of advancing them through     regulatory approval and commercialization. The Company acquired     Gloucester to enhance its portfolio of therapies for patients     with life-threatening illnesses worldwide.         The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts     being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed     at the acquisition date based upon their respective fair values     summarized below:                                    January 15, 2010                    Current assets            $       3,132              Developed product rights                197,000              IPR&D product rights                349,000              Other noncurrent assets                54                                    Assets acquired                549,186              Contingent consideration                (230,201       )          Net deferred taxes                (145,635       )          Other liabilities assumed                (21,347       )                                Net assets acquired                152,003              Goodwill                186,907                                    Cash paid            $       338,910                                        Asset categories acquired in the Gloucester acquisition included     working capital, inventory, fixed assets, developed product     right assets and IPR&D product right assets. Fair values of     working capital and fixed assets were determined to approximate     book values while the fair value of inventory was determined to     be greater than book value.         The fair value of developed product right assets was based on     expected cash flows from developed product right sales of     ISTODAX®      (romidepsin), a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor,     which was approved for marketing in the United States in     November 2009 by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell     lymphoma, or CTCL, in patients who have received at least one     prior systemic therapy. Prior to the acquisition, Gloucester was     also conducting a registration trial in peripheral T-cell     lymphoma, or PTCL, in the United States, which resulted in a     supplemental New Drug Application filing in December 2010 for     this indication. Fair values were derived using     probability-weighted cash flows. The U.S. CTCL developed     product right asset is being amortized over its economic useful     life of ten years. The compassionate use right asset is being     amortized evenly over the assets economic useful life of     1.5 years.         The fair value of IPR&D product right assets was based on     expected cash flows from sales of     ISTODAX®      (romidepsin) for the treatment of PTCL, which had not yet     achieved regulatory approval for marketing and has no future     alternative use. The $349.0 million estimated fair value of     IPR&D product rights was derived using          80    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          probability-weighted cash flows. The fair value was based on     expected cash flows from the treatment of PTCL in the United     States and PTCL in the European Union, or E.U., based on key     assumptions such as estimates of sales and operating profits     related to the programs considering their stages of development;     the time and resources needed to complete the regulatory     approval process for the products and the life of the potential     commercialized products and associated risks, including the     inherent difficulties and uncertainties in obtaining regulatory     approvals.         The U.S. PTCL IPR&D product right asset was assigned a     value of $287.0 million based on related future net cash     flows estimated using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 14.5% and     an anticipated regulatory approval date in mid-2011 with market     exclusivity rights expected to continue through 2017. The E.U.     PTCL IPR&D product right asset was assigned a value of     $62.0 million based on future net cash flows using a     risk-adjusted discount rate of 14.5% and an anticipated     regulatory approval date in mid-2015 with market exclusivity     rights expected to continue through 2021.         The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts     assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed     represents the goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition.     The Company does not expect any portion of this goodwill to be     deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill attributable to the     Companys acquisition of Gloucester has been recorded as a     noncurrent asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not     amortized, but is subject to review for impairment annually.         As part of the Companys consideration for the Gloucester     acquisition, it is contractually obligated to pay certain     consideration resulting from the outcome of future events. The     Company updates its assumptions each reporting period based on     new developments and records such amounts at fair value until     such consideration is satisfied.         The Gloucester acquisition included two contingent     considerations which would obligate the Company to make a     $180.0 million cash milestone payment to the former     Gloucester shareholders upon the marketing approval for the     U.S. PTCL IPR&D product right asset and a     $120.0 million cash milestone payment upon the marketing     approval for the E.U. PTCL IPR&D product right asset.         The initial fair value of contingent considerations was     $230.2 million, consisting of $156.7 million based on     the $180.0 million milestone payment upon U.S. PTCL     approval and $73.5 million based on the $120.0 million     milestone payment upon E.U. PTCL approval. The Company     determined the fair value of these obligations to pay additional     milestone payments upon approvals based on a     probability-weighted income approach. This fair value     measurement is based on significant input not observable in the     market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement within the     fair value hierarchy. The resulting probability-weighted cash     flows were discounted using a Baa rated debt yield of     6.15 percent, which the Company believes is appropriate and     representative of a market participant assumption. The range of     estimated milestone payments is from no payment if both product     indications fail to gain market approval to $300.0 million     if both product indications gain market approval. The Company     classified the contingent considerations as liabilities, which     were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair     value is based on the future milestone payments adjusted for the     probability of each payment and the time until each payment is     expected to be made.         Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company has measured the     contingent consideration arrangement at fair value each period     with changes in fair value recognized in operating earnings.     Changes pertaining to facts and circumstances that existed as of     the acquisition date will be recognized as adjustments to     goodwill. Changes in fair values reflect new information about     the IPR&D assets and the passage of time. In the absence of     new information, changes in fair value will only reflect the     passage of time as development work towards the achievement of     the milestones progresses and will be accrued based on an     accretion schedule. At December 31, 2010, the balance of     the contingent consideration was $252.9 million, of which     $171.9 million is included in other current liabilities and     $81.0 million included in other non-current liabilities.         81    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)      Pharmion     Corporation         On March 7, 2008, Celgene acquired all of the outstanding     common stock and stock options of Pharmion Corporation, or     Pharmion, in a transaction accounted for under the purchase     method of accounting for business combinations. Celgene paid a     combination of $920.8 million in cash and approximately     30.8 million shares of Celgene common stock valued at     $1.749 billion to Pharmion shareholders. The operating     results of Pharmion are included in the Companys     consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.         The 2008 acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method     of accounting for business combinations and the allocation of     the purchase price paid resulted in goodwill of     $556.4 million, developed product rights of     $509.7 million and an in-process research and development     charge of $1.740 billion.     Pro     Forma Information         The following table presents unaudited pro forma information as     if the acquisitions of Abraxis and Gloucester had occurred on     January 1, 2009.                                                Unaudited Pro Forma                  Consolidated Results                  Year Ended December 31,                 2010           2009                    Net Revenues            $       3,977,655               $       3,048,943              Net income attributable to Celgene            $       717,976               $       541,301              Diluted earnings per share attributable to Celgene            $       1.50               $       1.13                  The unaudited pro forma consolidated results were prepared using     the acquisition method of accounting and are based on the     historical financial information of the Company, Abraxis and     Gloucester. The historical financial information has been     adjusted to give effect to the pro forma events that are:     (i) directly attributable to the respective acquisition,     (ii) factually supportable and (iii) expected to have     a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited pro     forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of     what the Companys consolidated results of operations     actually would have been had we completed the acquisitions on     January 1, 2009. In addition, the unaudited pro forma     consolidated results do not purport to project the future     results of operations of the combined company nor do they     reflect the expected realization of any cost savings associated     with the acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated     results reflect primarily the following pro forma pre-tax     adjustments:                         Elimination of Abraxis historical intangible asset     amortization expense of approximately $32.0 million in the     pre-acquisition period in 2010 and $39.8 million in 2009.                    Additional amortization expense of approximately     $65.8 million in 2010 and $114.8 million in 2009     related to the fair value of identifiable intangible assets     acquired in the acquisitions of Abraxis and Gloucester.                    Adjustment of expense related to the accretion of contingent     consideration issued in the acquisition of Gloucester amounting     to a $6.4 million reduction of expense in 2010 and     additional expense of $23.7 million in 2009. No     corresponding adjustment was made for the change in value of     contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of     Abraxis as changes in the fair value of the Abraxis contingent     consideration is dependant on the market price of the publicly     traded CVRs.                    A net reduction of depreciation expense of approximately     $8.1 million in 2010 and $8.6 million in 2009     reflecting the cessation of depreciation expense on assets     acquired in the Abraxis acquisition that are classified as held     for sale, partially offset by an increase in depreciation     related to the fair value adjustment of property, plant and     equipment acquired.                    A reduction of interest income of approximately     $21.9 million in 2010 and $66.8 million in 2009     associated with cash and marketable securities that were used to     partially fund the acquisition of Abraxis.           82    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)                            Elimination of $34.7 million incurred in 2010 related to     the fair value adjustments to acquisition-date inventory from     the acquisition of Abraxis that has been sold, which is     considered nonrecurring. There is no long-term continuing impact     of the fair value adjustments to acquisition-date inventory,     and, as such, the impact of those adjustments is not reflected     in the unaudited pro forma operating results for 2010 and 2009.                    Elimination of $222.5 million of costs incurred in 2010,     which are directly attributable to the acquisition of Abraxis,     and which do not have a continuing impact on the combined     companys operating results. Included in these costs are     restructuring, advisory, legal and regulatory costs incurred by     both the Company and Abraxis.                    Adjusted basic and diluted shares of Celgene common stock to     reflect the addition of 10,660 shares of common stock     issued to stockholders of Abraxis. The common stock was assumed     to have been issued on January 1, 2009.           In addition, an income tax adjustment was included in the     calculation of the pro forma consolidated results using the     Companys U.S. statutory tax rate, estimated at 40%,     applied to the pro forma adjustments impacting taxable income.            3.     Restructuring            In connection with the October 15, 2010 acquisition of     Abraxis, the Company recorded a restructuring liability in the     amount of $16.1 million related to planned employee     termination costs. Employee termination costs are generally     recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include     accrued severance benefits and health insurance continuation,     many of which may be paid out during periods after termination.     The     following table summarizes restructuring liability activity     related to the Abraxis acquisition during the year ended     December 31, 2010:                                                                       Balance                        Balance              December 31,        Liability                December 31,              2009       Established       Payments       2010                Severance costs            $                      $       16,114               $       (1,233       )           $       14,881                  The Company does not expect to incur additional restructuring     expense in 2011 and additional cash payments related to the     restructuring activity are estimated to amount to     $10.4 million in 2011 and $4.5 million in 2012.     Acquisition-related charges and restructuring, net on the     accompanying 2010 Consolidated Statement of Operations includes     the above costs, the changes in the fair value of contingent     consideration and other miscellaneous legal, accounting and     investment banking costs.         The March 7, 2008 acquisition cost of Pharmion included     $58.6 million in restructuring liabilities primarily     related to the planned exit of certain business activities,     involuntary terminations and the relocation of certain Pharmion     employees. Payments totaling $0.3 million,     $15.4 million and $31.0 million were made in 2010,     2009 and 2008 respectively. There was no remaining liability for     the Pharmion restructuring at December 31, 2010.         83    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)             4.

Financial     Instruments and Fair Value Measurement            The table below presents information about assets and     liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis     as of December 31, 2010 and the valuation techniques the     Company utilized to determine such fair value. Fair values     determined based on Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices     (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or     liabilities. The Companys Level 1 assets consist of     marketable equity securities. Fair values determined based on     Level 2 inputs utilize observable quoted prices for similar     assets and liabilities in active markets and observable quoted     prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not     very active. The Companys Level 2 assets consist     primarily of U.S. Treasury securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,     U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed     securities,     non-U.S. government,     agency and Supranational securities and global corporate debt     securities. Fair values determined based on Level 3 inputs     utilize unobservable inputs and include valuations of assets or     liabilities for which there is little, if any, market activity.     The Companys Level 3 assets consist of warrants for     the purchase of equity securities in non-publicly traded     companies in which the Company has invested and which is party     to a collaboration and option agreement with the Company, in     addition to an investment in common shares of a small     biopharmaceutical company. The Companys Level 1     liability relates to          84    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          publicly traded CVRs.

Derivative     Instruments and Hedging Activities        Foreign Currency Forward Contracts:  The     Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge     specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign     currencies and to reduce exposures to foreign currency     fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in     foreign currencies.         The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to     protect against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash     flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates,     primarily associated with non-functional currency denominated     revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries. The foreign     currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at     December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 had settlement     dates within 36 months. These foreign currency forward     contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and to the extent     effective, any unrealized gains or losses on them are reported     in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, and reclassified     to operations in the same periods during which the underlying     hedged transactions affect operations. Any ineffectiveness on     these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in other     income, net. Foreign currency forward contracts entered into to     hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows at     December 31, 2010:                                                Notional Amount                 December 31,         Foreign Currency       2010           2009                    British Pound            $       58,440               $                     Canadian Dollar                133,128                                 Euro                675,438                   1,107,340              Japanese Yen                632,962                                 Swiss Franc                77,669                                 Others                54,644                                                                       Total            $       1,632,281               $       1,107,340                                                        The Company considers the impact of its own and the     counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the     contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its     obligations under the contract on an ongoing basis. As of     December 31, 2010, credit risk did not materially change     the fair value of the Companys foreign currency forward     contracts.         The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts     to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain     recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign     currencies. These foreign currency forward contracts have not     been designated as hedges and, accordingly, any changes in their     fair value are recognized in other income, net in the current     period. The aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency     forward non-designated hedging contracts outstanding at     December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $848.6 million and     $483.2 million, respectively.        86    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          The following table summarizes

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the     fair value of the 7.684% note payable to Siegfried     approximated the carrying value of the note of     $25.0 million in each year. Assuming other factors are held     constant, an increase in interest rates generally will result in     a decrease in the fair value of the note. The note is     denominated in Swiss francs and its fair value will also be     affected by changes in the U.S. dollar / Swiss     franc exchange rate. The carrying value of the note reflects the     U.S. dollar / Swiss franc exchange rate and Swiss     interest rates. The note is due to be repaid at the end of June     2016.         In June 2003, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount     of $400.0 million of unsecured convertible notes due June     2008, referred to herein as the convertible notes. The     convertible notes had a five-year term and a coupon rate of     1.75% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. Each     $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes was convertible     into 82.5592 shares of common stock as adjusted, or a     conversion price of $12.1125 per share. As of their maturity     date, June 1, 2008, pursuant to the terms of the indenture,     as amended, governing the convertible notes, substantially all     of the convertible notes were converted into an aggregate     33,022,740 shares of common stock at the conversion price,     with the balance paid in cash.         93    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)             12.

The following summary of intangible assets by     category includes intangibles currently being amortized and     intangibles not yet subject to amortization:                                                                        Gross                        Intangible            Weighted                  Carrying            Accumulated            Assets,            Average          December 31, 2010       Value           Amortization           Net           Life (Years)                    Amortizable intangible assets:                                                                           Acquired developed product rights            $       1,897,000               $       (384,891       )           $       1,512,109                   12.3              Licenses                64,250                   (2,271       )               61,979                   16.8              Technology and other                40,601                   (5,191       )               35,410                   8.8                                                                                               2,001,851                   (392,353       )               1,609,498                   12.4              Nonamortized intangible assets:                                                                           Acquired IPR&D product rights                1,639,000                                      1,639,000                                                                                                    Total intangible assets            $       3,640,851               $       (392,353       )           $       3,248,498                                                                                                                                                                     Gross                        Intangible            Weighted                  Carrying            Accumulated            Assets,            Average          December 31, 2009       Value           Amortization           Net           Life (Years)                    Amortizable intangible assets:                                                                           Acquired developed product rights            $       530,000               $       (185,733       )           $       344,267                   6.5              License                4,250                   (1,229       )               3,021                   13.8              Technology and other                3,098                   (844       )               2,254                   4.4                                                                                    Total intangible assets            $       537,348               $       (187,806       )           $       349,542                   6.5                                                                                        The $3.104 billion increase in gross carrying value of     intangibles at December 31, 2010 compared to     December 31, 2009 was primarily due to the acquisitions of     Abraxis and Gloucester, which resulted in increases in acquired     developed product rights of $1.170 billion from Abraxis and     $197.0 million from Gloucester, licenses of     $60.0 million from Abraxis, technology and other of     $37.5 million from Abraxis and acquired IPR&D product     rights of $1.290 billion from Abraxis and     $349.0 million from Gloucester.         Amortization of intangible assets was $204.5 million,     $84.3 million and $104.4 million for the years ended     2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amortization expense in 2010     included $95.8 million of expense associated with an     acceleration of amortization for the     VIDAZA®      intangible, which reflects an updated forecast related to     VIDAZA®,      $21.6 million from the amortization of intangible assets     acquired in the Abraxis acquisition and $21.8 million from     the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Gloucester     acquisition, partially offset by a reduction of     $19.4 million associated with certain acquired developed     product rights becoming fully amortized in late 2009. Assuming     no changes in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets,     the amortization of intangible assets for the next five years is     estimated to be approximately $286.3 million for 2011,     $135.4 million for 2012, $133.7 million for 2013,     $129.7 million for 2014 and $125.4 million for 2015.

Long-Term     Debt            Summarized below are the carrying values of the Companys     senior notes:                                    2010                    2.450% senior notes due 2015            $       499,301              3.950% senior notes due 2020                498,749              5.700% senior notes due 2040                249,534                                    Total long-term debt            $       1,247,584                                        On October 7, 2010, the Company issued a total of     $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting     of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of     2.45% Senior Notes due 2015 (the 2015 notes),     $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of     3.95% Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 notes)     and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of     5.7% Senior Notes due 2040 (the 2040 notes and,     together with the 2015 notes and the 2020 notes, referred to     herein as the notes). The notes were issued at     99.854%, 99.745% and 99.813% of par, respectively, and the     discount will be amortized as additional interest expense over     the period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of     approximately $10.3 million have been recorded as debt     issuance costs on the Companys consolidated balance sheet     and are amortized as additional interest expense using the     effective interest rate method over the period from issuance     through maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually     in arrears on April 15 and October 15 each year beginning     April 15, 2011 and the principal on each note is due in     full at their respective maturity dates. The notes may be     redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at     any time at a redemption price defined in a make-whole clause     equaling accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of 100% of     the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of     the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of     interest and principal. If a change of control of the Company     occurs accompanied by a downgrade of the debt to below     investment grade, the Company will be required to offer to     repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their     principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company     is subject to covenants which limit the ability of the Company     to pledge properties as security under borrowing arrangements     and limit the ability of the Company to perform sale and     leaseback transactions involving the property of the Company.         At December 31, 2010, the fair value of the Companys     Senior Notes outstanding was $1.197 billion.         The notes are the Companys senior unsecured obligations     and will rank equally with any of its future senior unsecured     indebtedness.            14.

Share-Based     Compensation            The Company has a stockholder approved stock incentive plan, the     2008 Stock Incentive Plan as amended and restated in 2009, or     the Plan, that provides for the granting of options, restricted     stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and     other share-based awards to employees and officers of the     Company. The Management Compensation and Development Committee     of the Board of Directors, or the Compensation          96    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          Committee, may determine the type, amount and terms, including     vesting, of any awards made under the plan. The Plan provides     for an aggregate share reserve of 70,781,641 shares of     common stock. Each share of common stock subject to full value     awards (e.g., restricted stock, other stock-based awards or     performance awards denominated in common stock) will be counted     as 1.6 shares against the aggregate share reserve under the     Plan.         In accordance with the Plan, each new Non-Employee Director,     upon the date of election or appointment, receives an award of a     nonqualified stock option to purchase 25,000 shares of     common stock, which vest in four equal annual installments     commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Upon     election as a continuing member of the Board of Directors, an     award is granted of a nonqualified stock option to purchase     12,333 shares of common stock and 2,055 Restricted Stock     Units, or RSUs, in each case, pro rated for partial years. The     stock options vest in full on the first anniversary of the date     of the grant and the RSUs vest ratably over a three-year period.     The foregoing split between stock options and RSUs is based on a     two-thirds and one-third mix of stock options to RSUs,     respectively, using a     three-to-one     ratio of stock options to RSUs in calculating the number of     RSUs. No discretionary award is permitted to be granted to     Non-Employee Directors, and the Compensation Committee will     administer the Plan with respect to awards for Non-Employee     Directors.         With respect to options granted under the Plan, the exercise     price may not be less than the market closing price of the     common stock on the date of grant. In general, options granted     under the Plan vest over periods ranging from immediate vesting     to four-year vesting and expire ten years from the date of     grant, subject to earlier expiration in case of termination of     employment unless the participant meets the retirement provision     under which the option would have a maximum of three additional     years to vest. The vesting period for options granted under the     Plan is subject to certain acceleration provisions if a change     in control, as defined in the Plan, occurs. Plan participants     may elect to exercise options at any time during the option     term. However, any shares so purchased which have not vested as     of the date of exercise shall be subject to forfeiture, which     will lapse in accordance with the established vesting time     period.         Shares of common stock available for future share-based grants     under all plans were 15,605,593 at December 31, 2010.

Share-based compensation cost included in inventory was     $2.4 million and $1.9 million at December 31,     2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, there     was $315.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost     related to stock options granted under the plans. That cost will     be recognized over an expected remaining weighted-average period     of 2.3 years.         The Company uses the Black-Scholes method of valuation to     determine the fair value of share-based awards. Compensation     cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite     service has not been rendered that are          97    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          outstanding is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of     Operations over the remaining service period based on the     awards original estimate of fair value and the estimated     number of awards expected to vest after taking into     consideration an estimated forfeiture rate.         The Company does not recognize a deferred tax asset for excess     tax benefits that have not been realized and has adopted the tax     law method as its accounting policy regarding the ordering of     tax benefits to determine whether an excess tax benefit has been     realized.     Stock Options:  Cash received from stock option     exercises for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and     2008 was $88.3 million, $49.8 million and     $128.6 million, respectively, and the excess tax benefit     recognized was $36.1 million, $97.8 million and     $153.0 million, respectively.         The weighted-average grant date fair value of the stock options     granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and     2008 was $18.59 per share, $20.10 per share and $25.94 per     share, respectively. The Company estimated the fair value of     options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with     the following assumptions:                                          2010       2009       2008                Risk-free interest rate            0.73%  2.50%           1.67%  2.91%           1.46%  4.02%          Expected volatility            30%  37%           37%  54%           39%  55%          Weighted average expected volatility            33%           46%           44%          Expected term (years)            2.7  5.1           3.8  5.0           3.5  4.9          Expected dividend yield            0%           0%           0%              The fair value of stock options granted is allocated to     compensation cost on a straight-line basis. Compensation cost is     allocated over the requisite service periods of the awards,     which are generally the vesting periods.         The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury     zero-coupon curve. Expected volatility of stock option awards is     estimated based on the implied volatility of the Companys     publicly traded options with settlement dates of six months. The     use of implied volatility was based upon the availability of     actively traded options on the Companys common stock and     the assessment that implied volatility is more representative of     future stock price trends than historical volatility. The     expected term of an employee share option is the period of time     for which the option is expected to be outstanding. The Company     has made a determination of expected term by analyzing     employees historical exercise experience from its history     of grants and exercises in the Companys option database     and management estimates. Forfeiture rates are estimated based     on historical data.         98    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          The following table summarizes all stock option activity for the     year ended December 31, 2010:                                                                                                Weighted                                          Weighted            Average Remaining                                          Average Exercise            Contractual            Aggregate                  Options           Price per Option           Term (Years)           Intrinsic Value                                                     (In thousands)                    Outstanding at December 31, 2009                37,450,036                   44.63                   7.0                   516,856              Changes during the Year:                                                                           Granted                9,904,882                   57.38                                              Issued  Abraxis acquisition                                                                           Exercised                (3,516,476       )               27.75                                              Forfeited                (1,630,024       )               56.05                                              Expired                (1,070,732       )               49.63                                                                                                                    Outstanding at December 31, 2010                41,137,686                   48.56                   6.7                   501,663                                                                                    Vested at December 31, 2010 or expected to vest in the     future                40,321,708               $       48.41                   6.6               $       498,184                                                                                    Vested at December 31, 2010                21,005,769               $       41.56                   4.9               $       405,289                                                                                        The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended     December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $41.2 million,     $29.3 million and $30.4 million, respectively.

As     of December 31, 2010, 167,122 options that contain the     reload features noted above are still outstanding and are     included in the tables above. The Plan was amended to eliminate     the reload feature for all stock options granted on or after     October 1, 2004.     Restricted Stock Units:  The Company began     issuing restricted stock units, or RSUs, under its equity     program during the second quarter of 2009 in order to provide an     effective incentive award with a strong retention component.     Equity awards may, at the option of employee participants, be     divided between stock options and restricted stock units, or     RSUs. The employee has three choices: (1) 100% stock     options; (2) a mix of stock options and RSUs based on a     two-thirds and one-third mix, using a     three-to-one     ratio of stock options to RSUs in calculating the number of RSUs     to be granted; or (3) a mix of stock options and RSUs based     on a fifty-fifty mix, using a     three-to-one     ratio of stock options to RSUs in calculating the number of RSUs     to be granted. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the     closing price of the Companys common stock on the grant     dates. Information regarding the Companys RSUs for the     years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows:                                                            Weighted                              Average                  Share            Grant Date          Nonvested RSUs       Equivalent           Fair Value                    Nonvested at December 31, 2009                502,440               $       40.41              Changes during the period:                                           Granted                1,156,973                   60.47              Vested                (68,642       )               49.37              Forfeited                (80,387       )               50.39                                                    Nonvested at December 31, 2010                1,510,384               $       54.84                                                        As of December 31, 2010, there was $62.4 million of     total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested     awards of RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a     weighted-average period of 2.2 years. The Company     recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the     requisite service period for the entire award, as adjusted for     expected forfeitures. The Company primarily utilizes newly     issued shares to satisfy the vesting of RSUs.            16.     Employee     Benefit Plans            The Company sponsors an employee savings and retirement plan,     which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal     Revenue Code, as amended, or the Code, for its     U.S. employees. The Companys contributions to the     U.S. savings plan are discretionary and have historically     been made in the form of the Companys common stock (See     Note 14). Such contributions are based on specified     percentages of employee contributions up to 6% of eligible     compensation or a maximum permitted by law. Total expense for     contributions to the U.S. savings plans were     $14.4 million, $10.6 million and $8.3 million in     2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company also sponsors     defined contribution plans in certain foreign locations.     Participation in these plans is subject to the local laws that     are in effect for each country and may include statutorily     imposed minimum contributions. The Company also maintains     defined benefit plans in certain foreign locations for which the     obligations and the net periodic pension costs were determined     to be immaterial at December 31, 2010.         In 2000, the Companys Board of Directors approved a     deferred compensation plan effective September 1, 2000. In     February 2005, the Companys Board of Directors adopted the     Celgene Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, effective     as of January 1, 2005, and amended the plan in February     2008. This plan operates as          100    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          the Companys ongoing deferred compensation plan and is     intended to comply with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,     which added new Section 409A to the Code, changing the     income tax treatment, design and administration of certain plans     that provide for the deferral of compensation. The     Companys Board of Directors froze the 2000 deferred     compensation plan, effective as of December 31, 2004, and     no additional contributions or deferrals can be made to that     plan. Accrued benefits under the frozen plan will continue to be     governed by the terms under the tax laws in effect prior to the     enactment of Section 409A. Eligible participants, which     include certain top-level executives of the Company as specified     by the plan, can elect to defer up to an amended 90% of the     participants base salary, 100% of cash bonuses and equity     compensation allowed under Section 409A of the Code.     Company contributions to the deferred compensation plan     represent a match to certain participants deferrals up to     a specified percentage (currently ranging from 10% to 20%,     depending on the employees position as specified in the     plan, and ranging from 10% to 25% through December 31,     2006) of the participants base salary. The Company     recorded expense of $1.5 million, $0.4 million and     $0.5 million related to the deferred compensation plans in     2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Companys recurring     matches are fully vested, upon contribution. All other Company     contributions to the plan do not vest until the specified     requirements are met. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the     Company had a deferred compensation liability included in other     non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of     approximately $46.3 million and $36.6 million,     respectively, which included the participants elected     deferral of salaries and bonuses, the Companys matching     contribution and earnings on deferred amounts as of that date.     The plan provides various alternatives for the measurement of     earnings on the amounts participants defer under the plan. The     measuring alternatives are based on returns of a variety of     funds that offer plan participants the option to spread their     risk across a diverse group of investments.         In 2003, the Company established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or     LTIP, designed to provide key officers and executives with     performance-based incentive opportunities contingent upon     achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives     covering a three-year period. The Company currently has three     separate three-year performance cycles running concurrently     ending December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Performance     measures for the Plans are based on the following components in     the last year of the three-year cycle: 25% on non-GAAP earnings     per share, 25% on non-GAAP net income and 50% on total non-GAAP     revenue, as defined.         Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the     participants salary for the LTIPs. The estimated payout     for the concluded 2010 Plan is $6.8 million, which is     included in other current liabilities at December 31, 2010,     and the maximum potential payout, assuming maximum objectives     are achieved for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 Plans are     $9.5 million, $11.3 million and $18.4 million,     respectively. Such awards are payable in cash or, at the     Companys discretion, payable in common stock based upon     its stock price on the payout date. The Company accrues the     long-term incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior     to the end of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an     estimate of the Companys level of achievement during the     cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled     to an immediate payment equal to their target award or, if     higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of     the change in control. For the years ended December 31,     2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized expense related to     the LTIP of $8.1 million, $5.5 million and     $6.3 million, respectively.            17.

As of December 31,     2010, the Company has not made a U.S. tax provision on     $3.934 billion of unremitted earnings of its international     subsidiaries. These earnings are expected to be reinvested     overseas indefinitely. It is not practicable to compute the     estimated deferred tax liability on these earnings.         Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between     financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as     temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect on     these temporary differences as deferred tax assets (generally     items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future     periods) or deferred tax liabilities (generally items for which     the Company received a tax deduction but that have not yet been     recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations). The     Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization     of deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of these     deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it     believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers     many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization     of deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings     experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future     taxable income, the carryforward periods available to it for tax     reporting purposes, tax planning strategies and other relevant     factors. Significant judgment is required in making this     assessment.         102    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS 

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)             The Company operates under an income tax holiday in Switzerland     through 2015 that exempts the Company from Swiss income taxes on     most of its operations in Switzerland. The impact of the Swiss     tax holiday is reflected in the Companys effective tax     rate. The difference between the maximum statutory Swiss income     tax rate (22.18% in 2010, 2009, and 2008) and the     Companys Swiss income tax rate under the tax holiday     resulted in a reduction in the 2010, 2009, and 2008 effective     tax rates of 15.8, 11.4, and 3.4 percentage points,     respectively. The impact of this item is included in the foreign     rate differential line in the above table.         At December 31, 2010, the Company had federal net operating     loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $280.0 million and combined     state NOL carryforwards of approximately $616.1 million     that will expire in the years 2011 through 2030. The Company     also has research and experimentation credit carryforwards of     approximately $24.8 million that will expire in the years     2015 through 2028. Excess tax benefits related to stock option     deductions incurred after December 31, 2005 are required to     be recognized in the period in which the tax deduction is     realized through a reduction of income taxes payable. As a     result, the Company has not recorded deferred tax assets for     certain stock option deductions included in its state NOL     carryforwards and research and experimentation credit     carryforwards. At December 31, 2010, deferred tax assets     have not been recorded on state NOL carryforwards of     approximately $124.9 million and for research and     experimentation credits of approximately $9.5 million.     These stock option tax benefits will be recorded as an increase     in additional paid-in capital when realized.         At December 31, 2010 and 2009, it was more likely than not     that the Company would realize its deferred tax assets, net of     valuation allowances. The principal valuation allowance relates     to Swiss deferred tax assets and is the result of the Swiss tax     holiday that does not expire until the end of 2015.         The Company realized stock option deduction benefits in 2010,     2009 and 2008 for income tax purposes and has increased     additional paid-in capital in the amount of approximately     $32.5 million, $98.8 million and $160.6 million,     respectively. The Company has recorded deferred income taxes as     a component of accumulated other comprehensive income resulting     in a deferred income tax asset at December 31, 2010 of     $0.3 million and a deferred income tax liability at     December 31, 2009 of $0.1 million.         The Companys U.S. federal income tax returns have     been audited by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the     IRS, through the year ended December 31, 2005. Tax returns     for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 are     currently under examination by the IRS and scheduled to be     completed within the next 12 months. The Company is also     subject to audits by various state and foreign taxing     authorities, including, but not limited to, most     U.S. states and major European and Asian countries where     the Company has operations.         The Company regularly reevaluates its tax positions and the     associated interest and penalties, if applicable, resulting from     audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings, as well     as changes in tax law that would reduce the technical merits of     the position to below more likely than not. The Company believes     that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open     years. Many factors are considered in making these evaluations,     including past history, recent interpretations of tax law and     the specifics of each matter. Because tax regulations are     subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently     uncertain, these evaluations can involve a series of complex     judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates     and assumptions. The Company applies a variety of methodologies     in making these estimates and assumptions, which include studies     performed by independent economists, advice from industry and     subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the IRS     and other taxing authorities, as well as the Companys     industry experience. These evaluations are based on estimates     and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management.     However, if managements estimates are not representative     of actual outcomes, the Companys results of operations     could be materially impacted.         Unrecognized tax benefits, generally represented by liabilities     on the consolidated balance sheet and all subject to tax     examinations, arise when the estimated benefit recorded in the     financial statements differs from the          104    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          amounts taken or expected to be taken in a tax return because of     the uncertainties described above. A reconciliation of the     beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as     follows:                                                2010           2009                    Balance at beginning of year            $       442,489               $       385,840              Increases related to prior year tax positions                9,131                   16,322              Decreases related to prior year tax positions                                                 Increases related to current year tax positions                118,012                   76,110              Settlements                (29,292       )               (35,783       )          Lapse of statute                                                                                       Balance at end of year            $       540,340               $       442,489                                                        These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues     common among multinational corporations. If recognized,     unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $504.7 million     would have a net impact on the effective tax rate. The Company     accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax     positions as part of its provision for income taxes. Accrued     interest at December 31, 2010 and 2009 is approximately     $32.5 million and $21.2 million, respectively.         The Company effectively settled examinations with various taxing     jurisdictions in 2010 and 2009. These settlements resulted in     decreases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related     to tax positions taken in prior years of $29.3 million in     2010 and $35.8 million in 2009. The Company has recorded     increases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for     prior years related to ongoing income tax audits in various     taxing jurisdictions.         The Companys tax returns are under routine examination in     many taxing jurisdictions. The scope of these examinations     includes, but is not limited to, the review of our taxable     presence in a jurisdiction, our deduction of certain items, our     claim for research and development credits, our compliance with     transfer pricing rules and regulations and the inclusion or     exclusion of amounts from our tax returns as filed. Certain of     these examinations are scheduled to conclude within the next     12 months. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the     liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change by a     significant amount during the next     12-month     period. Finalizing examinations with the relevant taxing     authorities can include formal administrative and legal     proceedings and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the     timing and range of possible changes related to our unrecognized     tax benefits. An estimate of the range of the possible change     cannot be made until issues are further developed or     examinations close.            18.     Collaboration     Agreements        Novartis Pharma AG:  The Company entered into     an agreement with Novartis in which the Company granted to     Novartis an exclusive worldwide license (excluding Canada) to     develop and market     FOCALIN®      (d-methylphenidate, or d -MPH) and FOCALIN     XR®,      the long-acting drug formulation for attention deficit disorder,     or ADD, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.     The Company also granted Novartis rights to all of its related     intellectual property and patents, including formulations of the     currently marketed RITALIN     LA®.      Under the agreement, the Company is entitled to receive up to     $100.0 million in upfront and regulatory achievement     milestone payments. To date, the Company has received upfront     and regulatory achievement milestone payments totaling     $55.0 million. The Company also sells     FOCALIN®      to Novartis and currently receives royalties of between 35% and     30% on sales of all of Novartis FOCALIN     XR®      and     RITALIN®      family of ADHD-related products.         The agreement will continue until the later of (i) the     tenth anniversary of the first commercial launch on a     country-by-country     basis or (ii) when the last applicable patent expires with     respect to that country. At the expiration date, the Company     shall grant Novartis a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free     license to make, have made, use, import and sell d-MPH and     Ritalin®      under its technology.         105    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         i. Novartis at their sole discretion, effective     12 months after written notice to the Company, or         ii. by:                 a.        either party if the other party materially breaches any of its     material obligations under the agreement,            b.        the Company if Novartis fails to pay amounts due under the     agreement two or more times in a     12-month     period,            c.        either party, on a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis, in the event of withdrawal of the d-MPH product or     Ritalin®      product from the market because of regulatory mandate,                   d.        either party if the other party files for bankruptcy.           If the agreement is terminated by the Company then all licenses     granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate and     Novartis will also grant the Company a non-exclusive license to     certain of their intellectual property related to the compounds     and products.         If the agreement is terminated by Novartis then all licenses     granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate.         If the agreement is terminated by Novartis because of a material     breach by the Company, then Novartis can make a claim for     damages against the Company and the Company shall grant Novartis     a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to make, have     made, use, import and sell d-MPH and     Ritalin®      under the Companys technology.         When generic versions of long-acting methylphenidate     hydrochloride and dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride enter the     market, the Company expects Novartis sales of Ritalin     LA®      and Focalin     XR®      products to decrease and therefore its royalties under this     agreement to also decrease.     Array BioPharma Inc.:  The Company has a     research collaboration agreement with Array BioPharma Inc., or     Array, focused on the discovery, development and     commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer and     inflammation. As part of this agreement, the Company made an     upfront payment in September 2007 to Array of     $40.0 million, which was recorded as research and     development expense, in return for an option to receive     exclusive worldwide rights for compounds developed against two     of the four research targets defined in the agreement, except     for Arrays limited U.S. co-promotional rights. In     June 2009, the Company made an additional upfront payment of     $4.5 million to expand the research targets defined in the     agreement, which was recorded as research and development     expense. Array will be responsible for all discovery and     clinical development through Phase I or Phase IIa and be     entitled to receive, for each compound, potential milestone     payments of approximately $200.0 million if certain     discovery, development and regulatory milestones are achieved,     and $300.0 million if certain commercial milestones are     achieved as well as royalties on net sales. During the fourth     quarter of 2010, the Company made a $10.0 million discovery     milestone payment as required by the collaboration upon the     filing and clearance of an investigational new drug application     with the FDA.         The Companys option will terminate upon the earlier of     either a termination of the agreement, the date the Company has     exercised its options for compounds developed against two of the     four research targets defined in the agreement, or     September 21, 2012, unless the term is extended. The     Company may unilaterally extend the option term for two     additional one-year terms until September 21, 2014 and the     parties may mutually extend the term for two additional one-year     terms until September 21, 2016. Upon exercise of a Company     option, the agreement will continue until the Company has     satisfied all royalty payment obligations to Array. Upon the     expiration of the agreement, Array will grant the Company a     fully     paid-up,     royalty-free license to use certain intellectual property of     Array to market and sell the compounds and products developed     under the agreement. The agreement may expire on          106    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis as the Company satisfies its royalty payment obligation     with respect to each product in each country.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         (i) the Company at its sole discretion, or         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches any of its material obligations     under the agreement, or         b. files for bankruptcy.         If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole     discretion or by Array for a material breach by the Company,     then the Companys rights to the compounds and products     developed under the agreement will revert to Array. If the     agreement is terminated by Array for a material breach by the     Company, then the Company will also grant to Array a     non-exclusive, royalty-free license to certain intellectual     property controlled by the Company necessary to continue the     development of such compounds and products. If the agreement is     terminated by the Company for a material breach by Array, then,     among other things, the Companys payment obligations under     the agreement could be either reduced by 50% or terminated     entirely.     Acceleron Pharma:  The Company has a worldwide     strategic collaboration with Acceleron Pharma, or Acceleron, for     the joint development and commercialization of ACE-011,     currently being studied for treatment of chemotherapy-induced     anemia, metastatic bone disease and renal anemia. The     collaboration combines both companies resources and     commitment to developing products for the treatment of cancer     and cancer-related bone loss. The agreement also includes an     option for certain discovery stage programs. Under the terms of     the agreement, the Company and Acceleron will jointly develop,     manufacture and commercialize Accelerons products for bone     loss. The Company made an upfront payment to Acceleron in     February 2008 of $50.0 million, which included a     $5.0 million equity investment in Acceleron, with the     remainder recorded as research and development expense. In     addition, in the event of an initial public offering of     Acceleron, the Company will purchase a minimum of     $7.0 million of Acceleron common stock.         Acceleron will retain responsibility for initial activities,     including research and development, through the end of Phase IIa     clinical trials, as well as manufacturing the clinical supplies     for these studies. In turn, the Company will conduct the Phase     IIb and Phase III clinical studies and will oversee the     manufacture of Phase III and commercial supplies. Acceleron     will pay a share of the development expenses and is eligible to     receive development, regulatory approval and sales-based     milestones of up to $510.0 million for the ACE-011 program     and up to an additional $437.0 million for each of the     three discovery stage programs. The companies will co-promote     the products in North America. Acceleron will receive tiered     royalties on worldwide net sales, upon the commercialization of     a development compound.         The agreement will continue until the Company has satisfied all     royalty payment obligations to Acceleron and the Company has     either exercised or forfeited all of its options under the     agreement. Upon the Companys full satisfaction of its     royalty payment obligations to Acceleron under the agreement,     all licenses granted to the Company by Acceleron under the     agreement will become fully     paid-up,     perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable and royalty-free licenses.     The agreement may expire on a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis as the Company satisfies its royalty payment obligation     with respect to each product in each country.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         (i) the Company at its sole discretion, or         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches any of its material obligations     under the agreement, or         b. files for bankruptcy.         107    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole     discretion or by Acceleron for a material breach by the Company,     then all licenses granted to the Company under the agreement     will terminate and the Company will also grant to Acceleron a     non-exclusive license to certain intellectual property of the     Company related to the compounds and products. If the agreement     is terminated by the Company for a material breach by Acceleron,     then, among other things, (A) the licenses granted to     Acceleron under the agreement will terminate, (B) the     licenses granted to the Company will continue in perpetuity,     (C) all future royalties payable by the Company under the     agreement will be reduced by 50% and (D) the Companys     obligation to make any future milestone payments will terminate.     Cabrellis Pharmaceuticals Corp.:  The Company,     as a result of its acquisition of Pharmion, obtained an     exclusive license to develop and commercialize amrubicin in     North America and Europe pursuant to a license agreement with     Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd, or DSP. Pursuant to     Pharmions acquisition of Cabrellis Pharmaceutics Corp., or     Cabrellis, prior to the Companys acquisition of Pharmion,     the Company will pay $12.5 million for each approval of     amrubicin in an initial indication by regulatory authorities in     the United States and the E.U. to the former shareholders of     Cabrellis. Upon approval of amrubicin for a second indication in     the United States or the E.U., the Company will pay an     additional $10.0 million for each market to the former     shareholders of Cabrellis. Under the terms of the license     agreement for amrubicin, the Company is required to make     milestone payments of $7.0 million and $1.0 million to     DSP upon regulatory approval of amrubicin in the United States     and upon receipt of the first approval in the E.U.,     respectively, and up to $17.5 million upon achieving     certain annual sales levels in the United States. Pursuant to     the supply agreement for amrubicin, the Company is to pay DSP a     semiannual supply price calculated as a percentage of net sales     for a period of ten years. In September 2008, amrubicin was     granted fast-track product designation by the FDA for the     treatment of small cell lung cancer after first-line     chemotherapy.         The amrubicin license expires on a     country-by-country     basis and on a     product-by-product     basis upon the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the     first commercial sale of the applicable product in a given     country after the issuance of marketing authorization in such     country and (ii) the first day of the first quarter for     which the total number of generic product units sold in a given     country exceeds 20% of the total number of generic product units     sold plus licensed product units sold in the relevant country     during the same calendar quarter.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the amrubicin     license may be terminated by:         (i) the Company at its sole discretion,         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches any of its material obligations     under the agreement, or         b. files for bankruptcy,         (iii) DSP if the Company takes any action to challenge the     title or validity of the patents owned by DSP, or         (iv) DSP in the event of a change in control of the Company.         If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole     discretion or by DSP under circumstances described in clauses     (ii)(a) and (iii) above, then the Company will transfer its     rights to the compounds and products developed under the     agreement to DSP and will also grant to DSP a non-exclusive,     perpetual, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property     controlled by the Company necessary to continue the development     of such compounds and products. If the agreement is terminated     by the Company for a material breach by DSP, then, among other     things, DSP will grant to the Company an exclusive, perpetual,     paid-up     license to all of the intellectual property of DSP necessary to     continue the development, marketing and selling of the compounds     and products subject to the agreement.         108    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)      GlobeImmune, Inc.:  In September 2007, the     Company made a $3.0 million equity investment in     GlobeImmune, Inc., or GlobeImmune. In April 2009 and May 2009,     the Company made additional $0.1 million and     $10.0 million equity investments, respectively, in     GlobeImmune. In addition, the Company has a collaboration and     option agreement with GlobeImmune focused on the discovery,     development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in     cancer. As part of this agreement, the Company made an upfront     payment in May 2009 of $30.0 million, which was recorded as     research and development expense, to GlobeImmune in return for     the option to license compounds and products based on the     GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug candidate     programs as well as oncology compounds and products resulting     from future programs controlled by GlobeImmune. GlobeImmune will     be responsible for all discovery and clinical development until     the Company exercises its option with respect to a drug     candidate program and GlobeImmune will be entitled to receive     potential milestone payments of approximately     $230.0 million for the GI-4000 program, $145.0 million     for each of the     GI-6200,     GI-3000 and GI-10000 programs and $161.0 million for each     additional future program if certain development, regulatory and     sales-based milestones are achieved. GlobeImmune will also     receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.         The Companys options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200,     GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs will     terminate if the Company does not exercise its respective     options after delivery of certain reports from GlobeImmune on     the completed clinical trials with respect to each drug     candidate program, as set forth in the initial development plan     specified in the agreement. If the Company does not exercise its     options with respect to any drug candidate program or future     program, the Companys option with respect to the oncology     products resulting from future programs controlled by     GlobeImmune will terminate three years after the last of the     options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and     GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs terminates. Upon     exercise of a Company option, the agreement will continue until     the Company has satisfied all royalty payment obligations to     GlobeImmune. Upon the expiration of the agreement, on a     product-by-product, country-by-country     basis, GlobeImmune will grant the Company an exclusive, fully     paid-up,     royalty-free, perpetual license to use certain intellectual     property of GlobeImmune to market and sell the compounds and     products developed under the agreement. The agreement may expire     on a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis as the Company satisfies its royalty payment obligation     with respect to each product in each country.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         (i) the Company at its sole discretion, or         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches any of its material obligations     under the agreement, or         b. files for bankruptcy.         If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole     discretion or by GlobeImmune for a material breach by the     Company, then the Companys rights to the compounds and     products developed under the agreement will revert to     GlobeImmune. If the agreement is terminated by the Company for a     material breach by GlobeImmune, then, among other things, the     Companys royalty payment obligations under the agreement     will be reduced by 50%, the Companys development milestone     payment obligations under the agreement will be reduced by 50%     or terminated entirely and the Companys sales milestone     payment obligations under the agreement will be terminated     entirely.     Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:  On April 14,     2010, the Company entered into a discovery and development     collaboration and license agreement with Agios Pharmaceuticals,     Inc., or Agios, which focuses on cancer metabolism targets and     the discovery, development and commercialization of associated     therapeutics. As part of the agreement, the Company paid Agios a     $121.2 million non-refundable, upfront payment, which was     expensed by the Company as research and development in the     second quarter of 2010. The Company also made an     $8.8 million equity investment in Agios Series B     Convertible Preferred Stock, representing approximately a 10.94%          109    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          ownership interest in Agios and is included in other non-current     assets in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The     Company receives an initial period of exclusivity during which     it has the option to develop any drugs resulting from the Agios     cancer metabolism research platform and may extend this     exclusivity period by providing Agios additional funding. The     Company has an exclusive option to license any resulting     clinical candidates developed during this period and will lead     and fund global development and commercialization of certain     licensed programs. With respect to each product in a program     that the Company chooses to license, Agios could receive up to     $120.0 million upon achievement of certain milestones plus     royalties on sales, and Agios may also participate in the     development and commercialization of certain products in the     United States. Agios may also receive a one-time milestone     payment of $25.0 million upon dosing of the final human     subject in a Phase II study, such payment to be made only     once with respect to only one program.         Unless the agreement is earlier terminated or the option term is     extended, the Companys option will terminate on     April 14, 2013. However, if certain development targets are     not met, the Company may unilaterally extend the option term:     (a) for up to an additional one year without payment;     (b) subject to certain criteria and upon payment of certain     predetermined amounts to Agios, for up to two additional years     thereafter.         Following expiration of the option, the agreement will continue     in place with respect to programs to which the Company has     exercised its option or otherwise is granted rights to develop.     The agreement may expire on a     product-by-product     and     country-by-country     basis as the Company satisfies its payment obligation with     respect to each product in each country. Upon the expiration of     the agreement with respect to a product in a country, all     licenses granted by one party to the other party for such     product in such country shall become fully     paid-up,     perpetual, sub licensable, irrevocable and royalty-free.         Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be     terminated by:         (i) the Company at its sole discretion after, or         (ii) either party if the other party:         a. materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such     breach within the specified period, or         b. files for bankruptcy.         The party terminating under (i) or (ii)(a) above has the     right to terminate on a     program-by-program     basis, leaving the agreement in effect with respect to remaining     programs. If the agreement or any program is terminated by the     Company for convenience or by Agios for a material breach or     bankruptcy by the Company, then, among other things, depending     on the type of program and territorial rights: (a) certain     licenses granted by the Company to Agios shall stay in place,     subject to Agios payment of certain royalties to the     Company: and (b) Celgene will grant Agios a non-exclusive,     perpetual, royalty-free license to certain technology developed     in the conduct of the collaboration and used in the program     (which license is exclusive with respect to certain limited     collaboration technology). If the agreement or any program is     terminated by the Company for a material breach or bankruptcy by     Agios, then, among other things, all licenses granted by Celgene     to Agios will terminate and: (i) Celgenes license     from Agios will continue in perpetuity and all payment     obligations will be reduced or will terminate;     (ii) Celgenes license for certain programs will     become exclusive worldwide: and (iii) with regard to any     program where the Company has exercised buy-in rights, Agios     shall continue to pay certain royalties to Celgene.         The Company has determined that Agios is a variable interest     entity; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of     Agios. Although the Company would have the right to receive the     benefits from the collaboration and license agreement and it is     probable that this agreement incorporates the activities that     most significantly impact the economic performance of Agios for     up to six years, the Company does not have the power to direct     the activities under the collaboration and license agreement as     Agios has the decision-making authority for the Joint Steering     Committee and Joint Research Committee until the Company     exercises its option to license a product. The Companys     interest in Agios is limited to its 10.94% equity ownership and     it does not have any obligations or rights to the future losses     or returns of Agios beyond this ownership. The collaboration     agreement, including the upfront          110    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          payment and series B convertible preferred stock     investment, does not entitle the Company to participate in     future returns beyond the 10.94% ownership and it does not     obligate the Company to absorb future losses beyond the     $8.8 million investment in Agios Series B Convertible     Preferred Stock. In addition, there are no other agreements     other than the collaboration agreement that entitle the Company     to receive returns beyond the 10.94% ownership or obligate the     Company to absorb additional losses.            19.     Commitments     and Contingencies        Leases:  The Company leases offices and     research facilities under various operating lease agreements in     the United States and international markets. At     December 31, 2010, the non-cancelable lease terms for the     operating leases expire at various dates between 2011 and 2018     and include renewal options. In general, the Company is also     required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes,     insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs     associated with the leases.         Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating     leases as of December 31, 2010 are:                                    Operating                  Leases                    2011            $       36,679              2012                26,046              2013                16,352              2014                15,634              2015                13,483              Thereafter                28,953                                    Total minimum lease payments            $       137,147                                        Total rental expense under operating leases was approximately     $36.4 million in 2010, $24.4 million in 2009 and     $20.4 million in 2008.     Lines of Credit:  The Company maintains lines     of credit with several banks to support its hedging programs and     to facilitate the issuance of bank letters of credit and     guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries. Lines of credit     supporting the Companys hedging programs as of     December 31, 2010 allowed the Company to enter into     derivative contracts with settlement dates through 2013. As of     December 31, 2010, the Company has entered into derivative     contracts with net notional amounts totaling $1.6 billion.     Lines of credit facilitating the issuance of bank letters of     credit and guarantees as of December 31, 2010 allowed the     Company to have letters of credit and guarantees issued on     behalf of its subsidiaries totaling $41.6 million.     Other Commitments:  The Companys     obligations related to product supply contracts totaled     $362.5 million at December 31, 2010. The Company also     owns an interest in two limited partnership investment funds.     The Company has committed to invest an additional     $8.0 million into one of the funds which is callable any     time within a ten-year period, which expires on     February 28, 2016.     Collaboration Arrangements:  The Company has     entered into certain research and development collaboration     agreements, as identified in Note 18, with third parties     that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing     and commercialization efforts with the potential for future     milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of     pre-established developmental, regulatory     and/or     commercial targets. The Companys obligation to fund these     efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs     and/or the     lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance     of the programs. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the     future potential payments are inherently uncertain, and     accordingly no amounts have been recorded in the Companys     accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31,     2010 and 2009.         111    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)      Contingencies:  The Company believes it     maintains insurance coverage adequate for its current needs. The     Companys operations are subject to environmental laws and     regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of     pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for     the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous     wastes. The Company reviews the effects of such laws and     regulations on its operations and modifies its operations as     appropriate. The Company believes it is in substantial     compliance with all applicable environmental laws and     regulations.         In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company received a Civil     Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Federal Trade     Commission, or the FTC. The FTC requested documents and other     information relating to requests by generic companies to     purchase the Companys patented     REVLIMID®      and     THALOMID®      brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to     believe that the Company has engaged in unfair methods of     competition. In the first quarter of 2010, the State of     Connecticut referenced the same issues as those referenced in     the 2009 CID and issued a subpoena. In the fourth quarter of     2010, the Company received a second CID from the FTC relating to     this matter. The Company continues to respond to requests for     information.         In the first quarter of 2011, the Company received a letter from     the United States Attorney for the Central District of     California informing the Company that it was under investigation     relating to its promotion of the drugs     THALOMID®      and     REVLIMID®      regarding off-label marketing and improper payments to     physicians. The Company is cooperating with the Unites States     Attorney in connection with this investigation.         On January 20, 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that     the jurisdiction of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board,     or the PMPRB, extends to sales of drugs to Canadian patients     even if the locus of sale is within the United States. As a     result of this rulling, the Companys U.S. sales of     THALOMID®      brand drug to Canadian patients under the special access program     are subject to PMPRB jurisdiction on and after January 12,     1995. In accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court of     Canada, we have provided to-date data regarding these special     access program sales to the PMPRB. In light of the approval of     THALOMID®      brand drug for multiple myeloma by Health Canada on     August 4, 2010, this drug is now sold through the     Companys Canadian entity and is no longer sold to Canadian     patients in the United States. The PMPRBs proposed pricing     arrangement has not been determined. Depending on the     calculation, the Company may be requested to return certain     revenues associated with these sales and to pay fines. Should     this occur, the Company would have to consider various legal     options to address whether the pricing determination was     reasonable.     Legal     Proceedings:         The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in     various patent, commercial and other claims; government     investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time     to time in the ordinary course of our business. These legal     proceedings and other matters are complex in nature and have     outcomes that are difficult to predict and could have a material     adverse effect on the Company. The Company records accruals for     such contingencies to the extent that it concludes that it is     probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the     related loss can be reasonably estimated.         Patent proceedings include challenges to scope, validity or     enforceability of the Companys patents relating to its     various products or processes. Although the Company believes it     has substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all     its material patents, there can be no assurance as to the     outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could     result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue,     which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and     could materially affect future results of operations.         Among the principal matters pending to which the Company is a     party, are the following:     REVLIMID®         The Company has publicly announced that it has received a notice     letter dated August 30, 2010, sent from Natco Pharma     Limited of India (Natco) notifying it of a     Paragraph IV certification alleging that patents listed for          112    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          REVLIMID®      in the Orange Book are invalid,     and/or not     infringed (the Notice Letter). The Notice Letter was sent     pursuant to Natco having filed an ANDA seeking permission from     the FDA to market a generic version of 25mg, 15mg, 10mg and 5mg     capsules of     REVLIMID®.      Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic     manufacturer may file an ANDA with a certification (a     Paragraph IV certification) challenging the     validity or infringement of a patent listed in the FDAs     Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence     Evaluations (the Orange Book) four years after     the pioneer company obtains approval of its New Drug     Application, or an NDA. On October 8, 2010, Celgene filed     an infringement action in the United States District Court of     New Jersey against Natco in response to the Notice Letter with     respect to United States Patent Nos. 5,635,517 (the     517 patent), 6,045,501 (the 501     patent), 6,281,230 (the 230 patent),     6,315,720 (the 720 patent), 6,555,554 (the     554 patent), 6,561,976 (the 976     patent), 6,561,977 (the 977 patent),     6,755,784 (the 784 patent), 7,119,106 (the     106 patent), and 7,465,800 (the     800 patent). If Natco is successful in     challenging our patents listed in the Orange Book, and the FDA     were to approve the ANDA with a comprehensive education and risk     management program for a generic version of lenalidomide, sales     of     REVLIMID®      could be significantly reduced in the United States by the     entrance of a generic lenalidomide product, potentially reducing     the Companys revenue.         Natco responded to the Companys infringement action on     November 18, 2010, with its Answer, Affirmative Defenses     and Counterclaims. Natco has alleged (through affirmative     defenses and counterclaims) that the patents are invalid,     unenforceable     and/or not     infringed by Natcos proposed generic productions. After     filing the infringement action, we learned the identity of     Natcos U.S. partner, Arrow International Limited, and     filed an amended complaint on January 7, 2011, adding Arrow     as a defendant.     ELAN     PHARMA INTERNATIONAL LIMITED         On February 23, 2011, the parties entered into a settlement     and license agreement for $78.0 million, whereby all claims     were resolved and we obtained the rights to certain patents in     and related to the litigation including rights to     U.S. Reissue Patent REI 41,884 (the Reissued     Patent), as well as all foreign counterparts, all of which     expire in 2016. Prior to the settlement, on July 19, 2006,     Elan Pharmaceutical Intl Ltd. filed a lawsuit against the     predecessor entity of Abraxis (Old Abraxis) in the     U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging     that Old Abraxis willfully infringed two of its patents by     making, using and selling the     ABRAXANE®      brand drug. Elan sought unspecified damages and an injunction.     In response, Old Abraxis contended that it did not infringe the     Elan patents and that the Elan patents are invalid and     unenforceable. Before trial, Elan dropped its claim that Old     Abraxis infringed one of the two asserted patents. Elan also     dropped its request for an injunction as to the remaining     patent. On June 13, 2008, after a trial with respect to the     remaining patent, a jury ruled that Old Abraxis had infringed     that patent, that Abraxis infringement was not willful,     and that the patent was valid and enforceable. The jury awarded     Elan $55.2 million in damages for sales of     ABRAXANE®      through the judgment date. For accounting purposes, Abraxis     assumed approximately a 6% royalty on all U.S. sales, moving     forward from the verdict, of     ABRAXANE®      brand drug, plus interest. The patent expired on     January 25, 2011.     ABRAXIS     SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT         Abraxis, the members of the Abraxis board of directors and the     Celgene Corporation are named as defendants in putative class     action lawsuits brought by Abraxis stockholders challenging the     Abraxis acquisition in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The     plaintiffs in such actions assert claims for breaches of     fiduciary duty arising out of the acquisition and allege that     Abraxis directors engaged in self-dealing and obtained for     themselves personal benefits and failed to provide stockholders     with material information relating to the acquisition. The     plaintiffs also allege claims for aiding and abetting breaches     of fiduciary duty against the Company and Abraxis.         On September 14, 2010, the parties reached an agreement in     principle to settle the actions pursuant to the Memorandum of     Understanding, or the MOU. Without admitting the validity of any     allegations made in the actions,          113    Table of Contents    CELGENE     CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS  (Continued)          or any liability with respect thereto, the defendants elected to     settle the actions in order to avoid the cost, disruption and     distraction of further litigation. Under the MOU, the defendants     agreed, among other things, to make additional disclosures     relating to the acquisition, and to provide the plaintiffs     counsel with limited discovery to confirm the fairness and     adequacy of the settlement. Abraxis, on behalf of itself and for     the benefit of the other defendants in the actions, also agreed     to pay the plaintiffs counsel $600,000 for their fees and     expenses. Plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against the     Company and Abraxis relating to the Companys acquisition     of Abraxis, except claims to enforce the settlement or properly     perfected claims for appraisal in connection with the     acquisition of Abraxis by the Company.         On November 15, 2010, the parties executed and filed a     stipulation and settlement with the Court and plaintiffs filed a     motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement.     On January 26, 2011, the Court granted plaintiffs     motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement,     certified the class for settlement purposes only and approved     the form of notice of the settlement of the class action.            20.

International     sales are primarily made directly to hospitals, clinics and     retail chains, many of which are government owned. In 2010, 2009     and 2008, the following two customers accounted for more than     10% of the Companys total revenue in at least one of those     years. The percentage of amounts due from these same customers     compared to total net accounts receivable is also depicted below     as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

In addition, quarterly and full year basic and diluted     earnings per share are calculated separately.              22.     Subsequent     Events            The results of the ongoing     ABRAXANE®      Phase III study in NSCLC, or the NSCLC study, were     presented at a major scientific congress in June 2010. These     results indicated that the primary endpoint of overall response     rate was met and that it achieved statistical significance. On     January 10, 2011, the Company further announced that it had     completed an interim analysis on the secondary endpoint for     progression free survival, or PFS, for the NSCLC study. These     interim PFS results, while not negative, were not statistically     significant. The NSCLC approval, if achieved, would be based on     the Special Protocol Assessment agreed upon with the FDA. The     Special Protocol Assessment states that the trial must reach the     primary endpoint of response rate, which has been met, as well     as showing that the secondary endpoint of PFS is not negative     or, trending in the wrong direction. The interim analysis did     not show a negative trend for PFS, and the     ABRAXANE®      arm was no worse than the comparator arm. This reduces the     probability that a payment will be made for Milestone     Payment #1 under the CVR agreement that the Company entered     into with the former shareholders of Abraxis (see Note 2).     Should the final analysis of the PFS data, which is expected in     the middle of 2011, not demonstrate a positive trend, then     Milestone Payment #1 under the CVR agreement has a high     probability of not being met. Milestone Payment #1 relates     to the marketing of     ABRAXANE®      under a label that includes a PFS claim, but only if the     foregoing milestone is achieved no later than the fifth     anniversary of the acquisition of Abraxis. The market value of     the publicly traded CVRs, which represents the fair value of the     Companys liability for all potential payments under the     CVR agreement, has therefore decreased from $212.0 million     at December 31, 2010 to $101.7 million at     February 10, 2011. In addition, the Company will adjust the     value of the liability for the CVRs as of the end of its first     quarter 2011, and at that time will consider the results of the     interim analysis of PFS when it performs impairment testing on     the IPR&D asset acquired with the Abraxis transaction.         On February 23, 2011, the Company entered into an interest     rate swap contract to convert a portion of its interest rate     exposure from fixed rate to floating rate to more closely align     interest expense with interest income received on its cash     equivalent and investment balances. The floating rate is     benchmarked to LIBOR. The swap is designated as a fair value     hedge on the fixed-rate debt issue maturing October 2015. Since     the specific terms and notional amount of the swap match those     of the debt being hedged, it is assumed to be a highly effective     hedge and all changes in fair value of the swaps will be     recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with no net impact     recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of     this filing, the total notional amount of debt hedged with an     interest rate swap is $125.0 million.         116    Table of Contents          ITEM 9.

CONTROLS     AND PROCEDURES       CONCLUSION     REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND     PROCEDURES         As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we     carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the     participation of our management, including our Chief Executive     Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the     design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures     (as defined in the Exchange Act     Rules 13a-15(e)     and     15d-15(e))     (the Exchange Act). Based on the foregoing     evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial     Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and     procedures are effective to ensure that information required to     be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under     the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported     within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the     Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is     accumulated and communicated to our management (including our     Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow     timely decisions regarding required disclosures.     CHANGES     IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING         The acquisition of Abraxis on October 15, 2010 represents a     material change in internal control over financial reporting     since managements last assessment of the effectiveness of     the Companys internal controls over financial reporting     which was as of September 30, 2010. The acquired Abraxis     operations utilize separate information and accounting systems     and processes and it was not possible to complete an evaluation     and review of the internal controls over financial reporting     since the acquisition was completed.         Management intends to complete its assessment of the     effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for     the acquired business within one year of the date of the     acquisition.         With the exception of the Abraxis acquisition as noted above,     there were no changes in our internal control over financial     reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010     that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to     materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.         117    Table of Contents    MANAGEMENTS     REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING         Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining     adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the     assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over     financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange     Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal     executive and principal financial officers and effected by our     Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide     reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial     reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial     statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted     accounting principles.         Our internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;     (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are     recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated     financial statements in accordance with generally accepted     accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures     are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our     management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable     assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that     could have a material effect on the consolidated financial     statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         In connection with the preparation of our annual consolidated     financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of     the effectiveness of our internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria     established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework     issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the     Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework. Managements     assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal     control over financial reporting and testing of the operational     effectiveness of those controls.         We acquired Abraxis BioScience, Inc. (Abraxis)     during 2010, and our management excluded from its assessment of     the effectiveness of our internal control over financial     reporting as of December 31, 2010, Abraxiss internal     control over financial reporting associated with total net     assets of approximately $3.2 billion (of which     approximately $2.6 billion represents goodwill and     identifiable intangible assets which are included within the     scope of the assessment) and total revenues of     $88.5 million included in our consolidated financial     statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.     Management intends to complete its assessment of the     effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for     the acquired business within one year of the date of the     acquisition.         With the exception of the Abraxis acquisition as noted above,     based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our     internal control over financial reporting was effective as of     December 31, 2010.         KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that     audited our consolidated financial statements included in this     report, has issued their report on the effectiveness of internal     control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, a     copy of which is included herein.         118    Table of Contents      REPORT OF     INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         The Board of Directors and Stockholders       Celgene Corporation:         We have audited Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries     internal control over financial reporting as of     December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in     Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the     Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway     Commission, or COSO. Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries     management is responsible for maintaining effective internal     control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the     effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,     included in the accompanying Managements Report on     Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is     to express an opinion on the effectiveness of Celgene     Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over     financial reporting based on our audit.         We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control     over financial reporting was maintained in all material     respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of     internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk     that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the     design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on     the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other     procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We     believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our     opinion.         A companys internal control over financial reporting is a     process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the     reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of     financial statements for external purposes in accordance with     generally accepted accounting principles. A companys     internal control over financial reporting includes those     policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance     of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly     reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the     company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions     are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial     statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting     principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company     are being made only in accordance with authorizations of     management and directors of the company; and (3) provide     reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of     unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the     companys assets that could have a material effect on the     financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over     financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future     periods are subject to the risk that controls may become     inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree     of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         In our opinion, Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries maintained,     in all material respects, effective internal control over     financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on     criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated     Framework issued by COSO.         Celgene Corporation acquired Abraxis BioScience, Inc.     (Abraxis) during 2010, and management excluded from     its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys     internal control over financial reporting as of     December 31, 2010, Abraxiss internal control over     financial reporting associated with total net assets of     approximately $3.2 billion (of which approximately     $2.6 billion represents goodwill and identifiable     intangible assets which are included within the scope of the     assessment) and total revenues of $88.5 million included in     the consolidated financial statements of Celgene Corporation as     of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our audit of     internal control over financial reporting of Celgene Corporation     also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over     financial reporting of Abraxis.         We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the     consolidated balance sheets of Celgene Corporation and     subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the     related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and     stockholders equity for each of the years in the     three-year period ended December 31, 2010, and our report     dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on     those consolidated financial statements.           /s/ KPMG LLP         Short Hills, New Jersey       February 28, 2011         119    Table of Contents          ITEM 9B.
