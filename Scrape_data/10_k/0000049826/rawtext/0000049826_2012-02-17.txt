The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:            Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.            Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.            Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.            Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.  The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.  Acquisitions and Divestitures  As part of the Companys ongoing strategy, the Company acquires businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Refer to the Acquisitions note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Companys acquired businesses.  The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Companys discontinued operations.  Current Year Developments  Refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    3    Financial Information about Segments and Markets  Segment and operating results are included in Item 7.

The principal end markets served by the Companys eight segments by percentage of revenue are as follows:                                             End Markets Served   Transpor-tation     PowerSystems &Electronics     IndustrialPackaging     FoodEquipment     ConstructionProducts     Polymers& Fluids     DecorativeSurfaces     AllOther     TotalCompany     Commercial Construction     1 %      4 %      6 %         %      22 %      11 %      55 %      1 %      8 %    Residential Construction                         2                  44        2        14                  6      Renovation Construction                                             26        2        30                  5      General Industrial     4        43        26        1        4        31        1        22        18      Automotive OEM/Tiers     56        4        1                            3                  4        12      Automotive Aftermarket     31        1                                      7                            6      Food Institutional/Restaurant                                   43                  1                            5      Food Service                                   36                  2                  3        5      Food Retail                         1        16                                      3        2      Consumer Durables     1        3        3                  2        4                  15        4      Food & Beverage                         13                            2                  21        6      Electronics               17        1                            1                  2        3      Primary Metals               3        21                            1                  2        4      Other     7        25        26        4        2        33                  27        16                                                                                                      100 %      100 %      100 %      100 %      100 %      100 %      100 %      100 %      100 %                                                                                               Other includes several end markets, some of which are maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, paper products, and printing and publishing.  The Companys businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors.  Backlog  Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Companys businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products. Backlog by segment as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is summarized as follows:     Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2012 were not material as of December 31, 2011.    4    The information set forth below is applicable to all industry segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:  Competition  With operations in 58 countries, the Company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and we encounter a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. Our competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of our segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition to numerous smaller regional competitors, the welding business in the Power Systems & Electronics segment competes globally with Lincoln Electric and the Decorative Surfaces segment competes globally with the Formica Group.  In virtually all segments, we compete on the basis of product innovation, product quality, brand preference, service delivery and price. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most of our segments. We believe that for each of our segments, our primary competitive advantages derive from our decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level, enabling our businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables our business units to drive operational excellence utilizing our 80/20 business process and leverages our product innovation capabilities. We also believe that our global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of our markets, especially in our Transportation and Decorative Surfaces segments.  Raw Materials  The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins, chemicals and paper, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.  Research and Development  Developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, and continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment all contribute to the Companys organic growth. Many new products are designed to reduce customers costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly or by improving the quality of customers assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Research and development expenses were $242,979,000 in 2011, $213,339,000 in 2010 and $191,859,000 in 2009.  Intellectual Property  The Company owns approximately 3,800 unexpired U.S. patents and 8,500 foreign patents covering articles, methods and machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,700 applications for patents pending in the United States Patent Office and 5,000 pending in foreign patent offices, but there is no assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.  The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important; however, the expiration of any one of the Companys patents would not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position. The Company also credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.  In addition to patents, many of the Companys products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company in the aggregate. Some of the Companys more significant trademarks include ITW, which is also used in conjunction with many of its businesses; Deltar and Shakeproof in the Transportation segment; Signode in the Industrial Packaging segment; Miller in the Power Systems & Electronics segment; Hobart in the Food Equipment segment; Paslode in the Construction Products segment; and Wilsonart in the Decorative Surfaces segment.  Environmental  The Company believes that its manufacturing plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Companys capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.  Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Companys revenues or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products.    5    Employees  The Company employed approximately 65,000 persons as of December 31, 2011 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.  International  The Companys international operations include subsidiaries and joint ventures in 57 foreign countries on six continents. These operations serve such end markets as construction, general industrial, automotive, food institutional/restaurant and service, food and beverage, electronics, consumer durables, primary metals, and others on a worldwide basis. The Companys revenues from sales to customers outside the United States were approximately 59% of revenues in 2011, 58% of revenues in 2010 and 58% of revenues in 2009.  Refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Segment Information note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  The Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Companys results are impacted by global economic conditions. Weakness or downturns in the markets served by the Company could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  During 2010 and 2011, many of our end markets showed improvement in general economic conditions, but European economic conditions slowed in the second half of 2011. We cannot be assured that we will not experience adverse effects from broad economic trends in Europe or other geographies. Instability in global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition.  The global nature of our operations subjects the Company to political and economic risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  The Company currently operates in 58 countries. In 2011, approximately 59% of the Companys revenues were generated from sales to customers outside of the U.S. As the Company continues to expand its global footprint, these sales may represent an increasing portion of the Companys revenues. The risks inherent in our global operations include:            fluctuation in currency exchange rates;            limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;            price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;            transportation delays and interruptions;            political, social and economic instability and disruptions;            acts of terrorism;            government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;            the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;            import and export controls;            labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;            the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises;            difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;            limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and            potentially adverse tax consequences.  If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition.  Our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital.  As part of our business strategy, we acquire businesses in the ordinary course. Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability:    7            Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable.            Acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from our expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term.            Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.            Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.            We may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated. The realization of any of these liabilities may increase our expenses or adversely affect our financial position.            As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.  We may incur fines or penalties, damage to our reputation or other adverse consequences if our employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery or other laws.  We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery laws, competition, and export and import compliance. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation.  A significant fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income.  Although the Companys financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in Europe. The Companys profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.  Diminished credit availability could adversely impact our ability to readily obtain financing or to obtain cost-effective financing.  The Company may utilize the commercial paper markets for a portion of its short-term liquidity needs. If conditions in the financial markets decline, there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving and long-term credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of our credit agreements. A failure of one or more of the syndicate members in our credit facilities could reduce the availability of credit and adversely affect our liquidity. If we determine that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future, funds may not be available on cost-effective terms.  Raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.  The supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and profit margins. Due to pricing pressure or other factors, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  If the Company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected.  The Companys ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Companys competitive position.  Protecting the Companys intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. The Companys intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of the Companys intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Companys competitive position and results of operations.    8    An unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the Companys growth rate.  Suitable acquisitions can be difficult to complete due to high valuations for attractive acquisitions, competition among prospective buyers, the need for antitrust or other regulatory approval and the availability of affordable financing. Changes in regulatory or accounting requirements or instability in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions. Our ability to grow through acquisitions depends on our ability to identify and successfully complete suitable acquisitions at appropriate prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to find attractive businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms. If the Company is unsuccessful in its efforts, its growth rate could be adversely affected.  Unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.  The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. The Companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.  Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.  The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.  Potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results.  The Companys businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. The Company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. Even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.

The Companys properties are primarily of steel, brick or concrete construction and are maintained in good operating condition. Productive capacity, in general, currently exceeds operating levels. Capacity levels are somewhat flexible based on the number of shifts operated and on the number of overtime hours worked. The Company adds productive capacity from time to time as required by increased demand. Additions to capacity can be made within a reasonable period of time due to the nature of the businesses.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  Common Stock Price and Dividend DataThe common stock of Illinois Tool Works Inc. was listed on the New York Stock Exchange for 2011 and 2010. Quarterly market price and dividend data for 2011 and 2010 were as shown below:     The approximate number of holders of record of common stock as of January 31, 2012 was 9,459. This number does not include beneficial owners of the Companys securities held in the name of nominees.         11    ITEM 6. Selected Financial Data     Certain reclassifications of prior years data have been made to conform to current year reporting, including the elimination of the one month lag for the reporting of the Companys international operations outside of North America (fiscal years 2010 and 2009 only), and discontinued operations as discussed below.  Prior to 2011, the Companys international operations outside of North America had a fiscal reporting period that began on December 1 and ended on November 30. Effective January 1, 2011, the Company eliminated the one month lag for the reporting of its international operations outside of North America. As a result, the Company is now reporting both North American and international results on a calendar year basis. The Company determined that the elimination of the one month reporting lag was preferable because the same period-end reporting date improves overall financial reporting as the impact of current events, economic conditions and global trends are consistently reflected in the financial statements of the North American and international business units. The Company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to fiscal periods 2010 and 2009. Refer to the International Reporting Lag note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of this change in accounting principle.  The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. For businesses reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income, all related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. Income (loss) from discontinued operations was $54,370,000, $50,514,000, $4,059,000, $(104,960,000), and $105,184,000 in the years 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Companys discontinued operations.  On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to business combinations. The new accounting guidance requires an entity to recognize assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance also requires prospectively that (1) acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred; (2) restructuring costs generally be recognized as post-acquisition expenses; and (3) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense. Refer to the Acquisitions note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of this change in accounting principle.  On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting guidance on fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The new accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and provides guidance for measuring fair values and the necessary disclosures. Refer to the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of this change in accounting principle.  On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to defined benefit plans which required the Company to change its measurement date to correspond with the Companys fiscal year-end. The Company previously used a September 30 measurement date. As allowed under the provisions of this new guidance, the Company elected to remeasure its plan assets and benefit obligation as of the beginning of the fiscal year. Upon adoption, the Company recorded an after-tax charge of $12,788,000 to beginning retained earnings and an after-tax gain to accumulated other comprehensive income of $3,573,000 related to the three months ended December 31, 2007.  Information on the comparability of results is included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    12    ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  INTRODUCTION  Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 58 countries. These businesses are internally reported as 52 operating segments to senior management. The Companys 52 operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Transportation; Power Systems & Electronics; Industrial Packaging; Food Equipment; Construction Products; Polymers & Fluids; Decorative Surfaces; and All Other.  Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Companys decentralized operating style, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.  The results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Companys results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues.  A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their businesses. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:            Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.            Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.            Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.            Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.  The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.    13    INTERNATIONAL REPORTING CHANGE  Effective January 1, 2011, the Company eliminated the one month lag for the reporting of its international operations outside of North America. As a result, the Company now reports both North American and international results on a calendar year basis. Prior to this, the international fiscal reporting period began on December 1st and ended on November 30th. The Company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior period financial statements presented. Refer to the International Reporting Lag note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the international reporting change.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. For businesses reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income, all related prior period income statement information has been restated to conform to the current year reporting of these businesses. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Companys discontinued operations.  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The Companys consolidated results of operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized as follows:     In 2011 and 2010, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:                                     2011 Compared to 2010     2010 Compared to 2009       % Increase (Decrease)     % Point  Increase(Decrease)     % Increase (Decrease)     % Point  Increase(Decrease)         OperatingRevenues     OperatingIncome     OperatingMargins     OperatingRevenues     OperatingIncome     OperatingMargins     Base business:                                  Revenue change/Operating leverage      7.5 %      21.0 %      1.9 %      10.1 %      40.7 %      2.8 %    Changes in variable margins and overhead costs                (4.9 )      (0.7 )                2.4        0.2                                                                          7.5        16.1        1.2        10.1        43.1        3.0                                                                     Acquisitions and divestitures      4.8        2.3        (0.4 )      3.2        2.2        (0.2 )    Restructuring costs                (0.6 )      (0.1 )                8.7        0.8      Impairment of goodwill and intangibles                                              7.5        0.7      Translation      3.1        3.4        0.1        0.4        1.5        0.1      Other                                    (0.1 )                                                                                            15.4 %      21.2 %      0.8 %      13.6 %      63.0 %      4.4 %                                                                  Operating Revenues  Revenues increased 15.4% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to higher base revenues, revenues from acquisitions, and the favorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues increased 7.5% in 2011 versus 2010 as worldwide economic conditions strengthened. However, European economic conditions slowed in the second half of the year. North American and international base revenues increased 9.0% and 5.7%, respectively, in 2011 versus 2010. Base revenues in Europe and China increased 5.6% and 14.2%, respectively, in 2011 versus 2010. End markets associated with welding, transportation and test and measurement businesses showed strength in 2011. In 2012, the company anticipates continued growth in North American and Asia Pacific markets with European markets expected to be relatively flat as compared to 2011.  Revenues increased 13.6% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to higher base revenues and revenues from acquisitions. Base revenues increased 10.1% in 2010 versus 2009 as the Company saw improvement in macroeconomic indices across many geographies as worldwide end markets began to recover from the global recession. North American and international base revenues increased 11.2% and 9.1%, respectively, in 2010 versus 2009. End markets associated with transportation, welding, industrial packaging, PC board fabrication and electronics showed improvement in 2010.    14    Operating Income  Operating income increased 21.2% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, the favorable effect of currency translation and income from acquisitions. Base margins increased 120 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues, partially offset by the negative impact of selling price versus material cost comparisons. Additionally, acquisitions and divestitures diluted margins by 40 basis points primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets.  Operating income increased 63.0% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring expenses, and 2009 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Base margins increased 300 basis points primarily due to the positive leverage effect of the increase in base revenues. Additionally, benefits from restructuring projects were partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. Lower restructuring expenses in 2010 versus 2009 reflect the Companys 2009 efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions. In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles, respectively, compared to $1.0 million in intangible asset impairment charges in 2010.  TRANSPORTATION  Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.

Total goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges by segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:                 In Thousands    2010      2009     Transportation    $          $ 12,347      Power Systems & Electronics                 85,043      Industrial Packaging                 386      Food Equipment                 53      Polymers & Fluids                 4,122      All Other      1,006         3,617                                 $ 1,006       $ 105,568                             The 2009 charges were primarily due to goodwill impairment charges related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit of $60.0 million, the PC board fabrication reporting unit of $18.0 million and the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service reporting unit of $12.0 million. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details of the impairment charges.  INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest expense increased to $192.1 million in 2011 which includes interest expense on the 3.375% and 4.875% notes issued in late August 2011, versus $175.2 million in 2010. Interest expense increased to $175.2 million in 2010 versus $164.6 million in 2009 primarily due to interest on the 6.25% and 5.15% notes which were issued in March 2009, partially offset by lower interest related to the 5.75% notes, which were repaid at maturity in March 2009, and lower commercial paper borrowings. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper was 0.1% in 2011, 0.2% in 2010 and 0.3% in 2009.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  Other income (expense) was income of $53.8 million in 2011 versus $10.0 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher interest income of $40.3 million (versus $24.1 million in 2010), lower losses on foreign currency transactions of $4.3 million (versus $16.7 million in 2010) and gains on disposal of operating affiliates of $1.8 million (versus losses of $8.0 million in 2010).  Other income (expense) was income of $10.0 million in 2010 versus expense of $4.5 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher income from investments of $20.8 million (versus $4.9 million in 2009).  INCOME TAXES  The effective tax rate was 22.2% in 2011, 30.5% in 2010, and 20.2% in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2011 was favorably impacted by the discrete non-cash tax benefit of $165.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the decision in the Companys favor by the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions that had been challenged by the Australian Tax Office. The effective tax rate for 2010 was unfavorably impacted by the discrete tax charge of $21.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. The effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by discrete tax adjustments in the fourth quarter of $85.5 million related to a global legal structure reorganization and $77.5 million related to a favorable settlement reached with the German tax authorities. In the above mentioned reorganization, the Company reorganized its ownership structure in certain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2009 and made an election regarding the U.S. tax treatment of a foreign subsidiary. The Company recorded a reduction in tax expense primarily for the effect of the resulting foreign tax credits. Also during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company finalized a settlement with the German tax authorities primarily regarding the treatment of an intercompany financing transaction which resulted in the reversal of previously established tax reserves as a reduction of tax expense.  See the Income Taxes note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details on these discrete tax adjustments and a reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  Income from continuing operations in 2011 of $2.0 billion ($4.08 per diluted share) was 38.9% higher than 2010 income of $1.5 billion ($2.89 per diluted share). Income from continuing operations in 2010 was 49.9% higher than 2009 income of $968.6 million ($1.93 per diluted share).    26    FOREIGN CURRENCY  The weakening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2011 versus 2010 increased operating revenues by approximately $460 million in 2011 and increased income from continuing operations by approximately 10 cents per diluted share. The weakening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2010 versus 2009 increased operating revenues by approximately $70 million in 2010 and increased income from continuing operations by approximately 4 cents per diluted share.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  Income from discontinued operations was $54.4 million in 2011 versus $50.5 million in 2010 primarily due to improved operating results in the held for sale finishing businesses partially offset by an after-tax loss on the sale of a discontinued operation in 2011 versus an after-tax gain in 2010. Income from discontinued operations was $50.5 million in 2010 versus $4.1 million in 2009 due to improved operating results in the held for sale finishing businesses and an after-tax gain on the sale of a discontinued operation in 2010 versus after-tax losses in 2009. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Companys discontinued operations.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The Companys primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, to continue to pay dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.  The primary uses of liquidity are:            dividend payments  the Companys dividend payout guidelines are 30% to 45% of the average of the last two years free operating cash flow;            acquisitions; and            any excess liquidity may be used for share repurchases.  Cash Flow  The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.  Summarized cash flow information for the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows:       27    On August 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common stock over an open-ended period of time (the 2007 Program). Under the 2007 Program, the Company made repurchases of approximately 16.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $53.51 and approximately 8.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.29 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2007 Program.  On May 6, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $4.0 billion of the Companys common stock over an open-ended period of time (the 2011 Program). Through December 31, 2011, the Company made repurchases of approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.20. As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately $3.9 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 Program.  Return on Average Invested Capital  The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its operations use of invested capital to generate profits. The Company believes that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Companys financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Companys operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. ROIC for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was as follows:     The 220 basis point increase in ROIC in 2011 versus 2010 was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 35.6%, primarily due to an increase in base business and a favorable tax rate, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital.  The 400 basis point increase in ROIC in 2010 versus 2009 was the result of after-tax operating income increasing 41.9%, primarily due to an increase in base business, partially offset by a less favorable tax rate and a slight increase in average invested capital.    28    Working Capital  Net working capital at December 31, 2011 and 2010 is summarized as follows:     Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the United States. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, or used to fund new international acquisitions. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, acquisitions, share repurchases, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses short-term credit facilities of $2.5 billion for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S. Debt  Total debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:     The Company issues commercial paper to fund general corporate needs and to fund small and medium-sized acquisitions. The Company has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. Of this amount, $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 10, 2016 and $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2013. The remaining $500.0 million is provided under a revolving credit facility that terminates on June 15, 2012. No amounts are outstanding under these three facilities. The Companys foreign operations also have unused capacity on uncommitted facilities of approximately $329 million.  The Company had outstanding commercial paper of approximately $192.5 million at December 31, 2011, which is included in short-term debt, and no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2010. The maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2011 was $1.8 billion while the average daily balance was $744.9 million.    29    In August 2011, the Company issued $350.0 million of 3.375% notes due September 15, 2021 at 99.552% of face value and $650.0 million of 4.875% notes due September 15, 2041 at 98.539% of face value. The effective interest rates of the notes are 3.4% and 4.9%, respectively. These notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equal in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to repay outstanding commercial paper.  The Company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow, debt-to-capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary. The Companys targeted debt-to-capital ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions.  Total Debt to EBITDA  The Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Companys long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.  Total debt to EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:     Stockholders Equity  The changes to stockholders equity during 2011 and 2010 were as follows:       30    CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  The Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 were as follows:     As of December 31, 2011, the Company has recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $187.8 million. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had open stand-by letters of credit of approximately $213.0 million, substantially all of which expire in 2012 and 2013. The Company had no other significant off-balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2011.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The Company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  These critical accounting policies are as follows:  Realizability of Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Generally, the Companys businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria:               Usage Classification     Criteria    Reserve %     Active    Quantity on hand is less than prior 6 months usage      0 %    Slow-moving    Some usage in last 12 months, but quantity on hand exceeds prior 6 months usage      50 %    Obsolete    No usage in the last 12 months      90 %   In addition, for approximately 44% of the U.S. inventories, the Company has elected to use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory costing. Generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method due to the effects of inflation.  Collectibility of Accounts Receivable  The Company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. In addition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts, which are also estimated based on past experience.  Depreciation of Plant and Equipment  The Companys U.S. businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis, as follows:           Buildings and improvements   150% declining balance   Machinery and equipment   200% declining balance  The majority of the international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations.    31    Income Taxes  The Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Companys deferred and other tax balances are based on managements interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the Companys various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The Companys business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the Companys total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the Company could incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its 52 reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.  As of December 31, 2011, the Company had total goodwill and intangible assets of $7.4 billion allocated to its 52 reporting units. Although there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its 52 reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the Companys 80/20 business simplification process. The amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units range from approximately $5 million to $830 million, with the average amount equal to $140 million.  Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the Companys global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  The Company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. Pension and other postretirement expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participants years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.  The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the U.S. primary pension plan. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $32 million.  The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.0% for 2011 and will be 8.0% for 2012. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $3 million. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information on how this rate is determined.    32    ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  MARKET RISK  Interest Rate Risk  The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys debt.  The following table presents the Companys debt for which fair value is subject to changing market interest rates:     Foreign Currency Risk  The Company operates in the United States and 57 other countries. In general, the Companys products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country. The initial funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the U.S. parent company. Therefore, the Company and its subsidiaries do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. As such, the Company does not have any significant derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to foreign currency risk at December 31, 2011 or 2010.  In October 2007, the Company issued 750.0 million of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014. The Company has significant operations with the Euro as their functional currency. The Company believes that the Euro cash flows from these businesses will be adequate to fund the debt obligations under these notes.    33    ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  The management of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). ITWs internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  ITW management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2011, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.  The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report herein.           /s/ David B. Speer David B. Speer Chairman & Chief Executive Officer February 17, 2012    /s/ Ronald D. Kropp Ronald D. Kropp Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer February 17, 2012          34    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Illinois Tool Works Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of income, income reinvested in the business, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  As discussed in the International Reporting Lag note within the Notes to Financial Statements, on January 1, 2011, the Company elected to change its method of accounting to eliminate a one-month lag for reporting its international operations outside of North America, which was retrospectively adjusted in the Companys 2010 and 2009 consolidated financial statements.  /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP  Deloitte & Touche LLP  Chicago, Illinois  February 17, 2012    35    Statement of Income  Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries     The Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.    36    Statement of Income Reinvested in the Business  Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries     Statement of Comprehensive Income  Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries     The Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.    37    Statement of Financial Position  Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries     The Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.    38    Statement of Cash Flows  Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries     The Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.    39    Notes to Financial Statements  The Notes to Financial Statements furnish additional information on items in the financial statements. The notes have been arranged in the same order as the related items appear in the statements.    Nature Of Operations Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 58 countries. The Company primarily serves the construction, general industrial, food institutional/restaurant, automotive OEM/tiers, automotive aftermarket, and food and beverage markets.    Significant Accounting Policies Significant accounting principles and policies of the Company are in italics. Certain reclassifications of prior years data have been made to conform to current year reporting.  The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant estimates included in the preparation of the financial statements are related to inventories, trade receivables, plant and equipment, income taxes, goodwill and intangible assets, product liability matters, litigation, product warranties, pensions, other postretirement benefits, environmental matters and stock options.    International Reporting Lag International Reporting Lag   Prior to 2011, the Companys international operations outside of North America had a fiscal reporting period that began on December 1 and ended on November 30. Effective January 1, 2011, the Company eliminated the one month lag for the reporting of its international operations outside of North America. As a result,  the Company is now reporting both North American and international results on a calendar year basis.  The Company determined that the elimination of the one month reporting lag was preferable because the same period-end reporting date improves overall financial reporting as the impact of current events, economic conditions and global trends are consistently reflected in the financial statements of the North American and international business units.  The Company has applied this change in accounting principle retrospectively to all prior financial statement periods presented. The impact of the elimination of the one month reporting lag for international operations outside of North America for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows:                   Increase (Decrease)                In Thousands Except per Share Amounts    2010     2009     Operating revenues    $ (21,796 )    $ 91,574      Income from continuing operations      (24,877 )      26,023      Income from continuing operations per diluted share      (0.04 )      0.05      Net income      (24,241 )      25,688      Net income per diluted share      (0.04 )      0.05     The cumulative effect of adopting this change in accounting principle was recorded as an after-tax increase of $7,274,000 to income reinvested in the business as of January 1, 2009.    Consolidation and Translation Consolidation and TranslationThe financial statements include the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from the financial statements.  Foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity.    Discontinued Operations Discontinued Operations  The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. In April 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its finishing group of businesses included within the All Other segment to Graco Inc. in a $650,000,000 cash transaction. In December 2011, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint challenging Gracos acquisition of the finishing business. The Company intends to divest the finishing business in 2012. The finishing business has been classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 2011.  In the second quarter of 2011, the Companys Board of Directors approved plans to divest a consumer packaging business in the All Other segment and an electronic components business in the Power Systems & Electronics segment. The electronic components business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2011. The Company expects to divest the consumer packaging business in 2012. The consumer packaging business has been classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 2011.    40    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)    The Company exited a flooring business in the Decorative Surfaces segment in early 2011 and sold a security printing business in the All Other segment in the third quarter of 2010.  In 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software business which was previously reported in the All Other segment. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale of the Click Commerce business. Additionally, in 2009, the Company sold an automotive components business which was previously reported in the Transportation segment.  The consolidated statement of income and the notes to financial statements have been restated to present the operating results of the held for sale and previously divested or exited businesses discussed above as discontinued operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009.  Results of the discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:       Income before taxes from discontinued operations included a $3,675,000 loss related to the sale of the electronics components business in 2011, a $19,559,000 gain related to the sale of the security printing business in 2010, and losses of $27,665,000 related to the sale of the Click Commerce and automotive components businesses in 2009.  There were no businesses held for sale as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The assets and liabilities of the held for sale finishing and consumer packaging businesses discussed above were included in assets and liabilities held for sale in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2011 as follows:               In Thousands    December 31, 2011     Trade receivables    $ 71,684      Inventories      55,642      Net plant and equipment      44,635      Goodwill and intangible assets      201,526      Other      12,837                   Total assets held for sale    $ 386,324                   Accounts payable    $ 21,672      Accrued expenses      54,723      Other      30,453                   Total liabilities held for sale    $ 106,848                    41    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)      Acquisitions AcquisitionsThe Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method, in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The operating results of the acquired companies are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  Acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, did not materially affect the Companys results of operations or financial position for any period presented. Summarized information related to acquisitions is as follows:       The premium over tangible net assets recorded for acquisitions based on purchase price allocations during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows:                                       2011      2010      2009     In Thousands except for weighted-average lives (years)    Weighted-AverageLife      PremiumRecorded      Weighted-AverageLife      PremiumRecorded      Weighted-AverageLife      PremiumRecorded     Goodwill          $ 475,634             $ 219,222             $ 95,936      Amortizable intangible assets:                                       Customer lists and relationships      12.2         362,387         11.8         120,845         10.7         48,152      Patents and proprietary technology      9.6         98,117         10.9         31,986         12.3         30,421      Trademarks and brands      17.3         245,295         14.9         70,667         14.0         19,732      Noncompete agreements      5.0         26,818         5.3         4,617         6.2         8,859      Other      1.8         10,307         4.9         12,572         4.4         6,846                                                           Total amortizable intangible assets      13.1         742,924         12.1         240,687         10.9         114,010      Indefinite-lived intangible assets:                                       Trademarks and brands            5,481                                12,254                                                           Total premium recorded          $ 1,224,039             $ 459,909             $ 222,200                                                          Of the total goodwill recorded for acquisitions, the Company expects goodwill of $302,146,000 in 2011, $51,304,000 in 2010 and $72,216,000 in 2009 will be tax deductible.  On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting guidance related to business combinations. The new accounting guidance requires an entity to recognize assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. The new guidance also requires prospectively that (1) acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred; (2) restructuring costs generally be recognized as a post-acquisition expense; and (3) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense. Upon adoption of the new guidance, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to income reinvested in the business of $1,055,000 in 2009.    Operating Revenues Operating Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally at the time of product shipment. Typical sales arrangements are for standard products and provide for transfer of ownership and risk of loss at the time of shipment. In limited circumstances where significant obligations to the customer are unfulfilled at the time of shipment, typically involving installation and customer acceptance, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been completed. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues.  No single customer accounted for more than 5% of consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 or 2009.  In October 2009, new accounting guidance was issued on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The new accounting guidance amends the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable the vendor to account for product or services separately rather than as a combined unit. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence, (2) third-party evidence or (3) estimates. The Company adopted the new accounting guidance on January 1, 2011, and the adoption did not materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations.    Research and Development Expenses Research and Development Expenses are recorded as expense in the year incurred.  These costs were $242,979,000 in 2011, $213,339,000 in 2010 and $191,859,000 in 2009.    42    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)      Rental Expense Rental Expense was $178,439,000 in 2011, $165,171,000 in 2010 and $170,561,000 in 2009. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases for the years ending December 31 are as follows:         Advertising Expenses Advertising Expenses are recorded as expense in the year incurred.  These costs were $87,965,000 in 2011, $72,016,000 in 2010 and $63,290,000 in 2009.    Other Income (Expense) Other Income (Expense) consisted of the following:         Income Taxes Income TaxesThe Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax laws.  The components of the provision for income taxes were as shown below:         43    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)    Income from continuing operations before income taxes for domestic and foreign operations was as follows:       The reconciliation between the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was as follows:                           2011     2010     2009     U.S. Federal statutory tax rate      35.0 %      35.0 %      35.0 %    State income taxes, net of U.S. Federal tax benefit      1.1        1.2        0.8      Nondeductible goodwill impairment                          2.5      Differences between U.S. Federal statutory and foreign tax rates      (2.7 )      (2.0 )      (3.3 )    Nontaxable foreign interest income      (3.6 )      (3.4 )      (4.6 )    Foreign tax credit related to a global legal structure reorganization                          (7.0 )    German tax audit settlement                          (4.7 )    Australian court decision      (6.4 )                        Tax effect of foreign dividends      0.4        0.5        1.3      Tax relief for U.S. manufacturers      (1.3 )      (1.3 )      (0.7 )    Other, net      (0.3 )      0.5        0.9                                       Effective tax rate      22.2 %      30.5 %      20.2 %                                    Deferred U.S. Federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on the remaining undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries of approximately $6,300,000,000 and $5,700,000,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as these earnings are considered permanently invested.  Upon repatriation of these earnings to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. The actual U.S. tax cost would depend on income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution. Determination of the related tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.  The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:       Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The valuation allowances recorded at December 31, 2011 and 2010 relate primarily to certain net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards.    44    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)    At December 31, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which expire as follows:       The Company has foreign tax credit carryovers of $871,000 as of December 31, 2011 and $94,100,000 as of December 31, 2010 that are available for use by the Company between 2012 and 2020.  The changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:       Included in the balance at December 31, 2011 are approximately $437,000,000 of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the Companys effective tax rate.  The Company has been litigating its dispute with the Australian Tax Office over the tax treatment of an intercompany financing transaction between the U.S. and Australia. The case was heard before the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, in September 2010. The proceedings resulted from the Companys appeal of a decision by the Australian Tax Commissioner to disallow income tax deductions for the income tax years 2002 through 2005 and the assessment of withholding taxes for income tax year 2003. The Company also contested the Commissioners similar determination for income tax years 2006 and 2007; however, the parties agreed to follow the Courts decision made on the earlier years. On February 4, 2011, the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria, decided in the Companys favor with respect to a significant portion of the income tax deductions. The Court issued the final orders on February 18, 2011. Based on this decision, the Company decreased its unrecognized tax benefits related to this matter by approximately $197,000,000 and recorded a favorable discrete non-cash tax benefit to reduce tax expense by $165,927,000 in the first quarter of 2011. The Australian Tax Office has appealed the timing of certain of the deductions, the outcome of which is not expected to be material.  During the first quarter of 2011, the Company resolved an issue with the Internal Revenue Service in the United States related to a deduction for foreign exchange losses on an intercompany loan that resulted in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $179,000,000.    45    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)    In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. As a result, future tax deductions for retiree prescription drug coverage will be reduced by the amount of subsidies received starting in 2013. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a discrete tax charge of $21,881,000 for the impact of the health care reform legislation.  The Company settled several items during 2009 related to its German and U.S. tax audits. The most significant issues related to a financing transaction, leveraged leases and mortgage-backed securities.  The Company files numerous consolidated and separate tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The following table summarizes the open tax years for the Companys major jurisdictions:       The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.  The accrual for interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1,775,000 and $40,000,000, respectively.    Income Per Share from Continuing Operations Income Per Share from Continuing Operations is computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period. Income from continuing operations per diluted share is computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted-average number of shares assuming dilution for stock options and restricted stock units.  Dilutive shares reflect the potential additional shares that would be outstanding if the dilutive stock options outstanding were exercised and the unvested restricted stock units vested during the period. The computation of income per share from continuing operations was as follows:                       In Thousands except per share amounts    2011      2010      2009     Income from continuing operations    $ 2,017,014       $ 1,452,438       $ 968,638                                         Income per share from continuing operationsBasic:                     Weighted-average common shares      491,439         500,772         500,177                                         Income per share from continuing operationsBasic    $ 4.10       $ 2.90       $ 1.94                                         Income per share from continuing operationsDiluted:                     Weighted-average common shares      491,439         500,772         500,177      Effect of dilutive stock options and restricted stock units      3,207         2,578         1,744                                         Weighted-average common shares assuming dilution      494,646         503,350         501,921                                         Income per share from continuing operationsDiluted    $ 4.08       $ 2.89       $ 1.93                                        Options that were considered antidilutive were not included in the computation of diluted income per share from continuing operations.  The antidilutive options outstanding as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 5,005,664, 10,434,146 and 14,581,559, respectively.    Cash and Equivalents Cash and Equivalents  included interest-bearing instruments of $551,342,000 at December 31, 2011 and $694,272,000 at December 31, 2010.  Interest-bearing instruments have maturities of 90 days or less and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.     46    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)      Trade Receivables Trade Receivables were net of allowances for uncollectible accounts. The changes in the allowances for uncollectible accounts during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:       Inventories Inventories  at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material, labor and factory overhead. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method is used to determine the cost of the inventories of approximately 44% of the U.S. inventories. Inventories priced at LIFO were approximately 22% and 21% of total inventories as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which approximates current cost, is used for all other inventories.  If the FIFO method was used for all inventories, total inventories would have been approximately $127,725,000 and $122,888,000 higher than reported at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.    Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:       Plant and Equipment Plant and Equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Renewals and improvements that increase the useful life of plant and equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.   Depreciation was $334,331,000 in 2011, $327,520,000 in 2010 and $367,196,000 in 2009, and was reflected primarily in cost of revenues. Depreciation included in income from discontinued operations was $2,164,000 in 2011, $7,266,000 in 2010 and $9,030,000 in 2009.  Depreciation of plant and equipment for financial reporting purposes is computed on an accelerated basis for U.S. businesses and on a straight-line basis for a majority of the international businesses.   The ranges of useful lives used to depreciate plant and equipment are as follows:             Buildings and improvements      550 years      Machinery and equipment      312 years      Equipment leased to others      Term of lease       47    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)      Investments Investments as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of the following:     Leases of Equipment  The components of the investment in leases of equipment at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as shown below:                 In Thousands    2011     2010     Leveraged and direct financing leases:              Gross lease contracts receivable, net of nonrecourse debt service    $ 130,284      $ 145,687      Estimated residual value of leased assets      247,512        247,512      Unearned income      (109,834 )      (120,863 )                                267,962        272,336      Equipment under operating leases      7,415        8,731                                $ 275,377      $ 281,067                            Deferred tax liabilities related to leases of equipment were $54,262,000 and $56,170,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The investment in leases of equipment at December 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of the following types of equipment:     In 2002, the Company entered into leveraged leasing transactions related to mobile telecommunications equipment with two major European telecommunications companies with a cash investment of $144,676,000. In 2003, the Company entered into a leveraged lease transaction related to air traffic control equipment in Australia with a cash investment of $48,763,000. Under the terms of the telecommunications and air traffic control lease transactions, the lessees have made upfront payments to third-party financial institutions that are acting as payment undertakers. These payment undertakers are obligated to make the required scheduled payments directly to the nonrecourse debt holders and to the lessors, including the Company. In the event of default by the lessees, the Company has the right to recover its net investment from the payment undertakers. In addition, the lessees are required to purchase residual value insurance from a creditworthy third party at a date near the end of the lease term.  Income from leveraged leases was $13,372,000, $10,513,000, and $7,618,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Unearned income related to leveraged leases is recognized as lease income over the life of the lease based on the effective yield of the lease. The Company adjusts recognition of lease income on its leveraged leases when there is a change in the assumptions affecting total income or the timing of cash flows associated with the lease. The residual values of leased assets are estimated at the inception of the lease based on market appraisals and reviewed for impairment at least annually.     48    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)      Other Investments  The Company entered into a venture capital limited partnership in 2001 that invests primarily in late-stage venture capital opportunities. The Company has a 25% limited partnership interest and accounts for this investment using the equity method, whereby the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the partnerships income or loss. The partnerships financial statements are prepared on a mark-to-market basis.  The Company has entered into several affordable housing limited partnerships primarily to receive tax benefits in the form of tax credits and tax deductions from operating losses.  These affordable housing investments are accounted for using the effective yield method, in which the investment is amortized to income tax expense as the tax benefits are received. The tax credits are credited to income tax expense as they are allocated to the Company.  The Company has invested in property developments with a residential construction developer through partnerships in which the Company has a 50% interest.  These partnership investments are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the partnerships income or loss.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses.  The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset.   On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting guidance on fair value measurements for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The new accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and provides guidance for measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures.  When performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company evaluates the goodwill assigned to each of its 52 reporting units for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company uses various valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its reporting units, including discounting estimated future cash flows based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit, market multiples and quoted market prices of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill.  The Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets are determined based on a relief-of-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.  Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:                     In Thousands    2011      2010      2009     Goodwill:                     Impairment    $          $          $ 90,000      Intangible Assets:                     Amortization      255,338         207,427         197,469      Impairment                 1,006         15,568                                            $ 255,338       $ 208,433       $ 303,037                                        Income from discontinued operations included intangible asset amortization of $2,176,000 in 2011, $5,567,000 in 2010 and $5,578,000 in 2009.  In 2011, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment which resulted in no goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges.  In 2010, the Company performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment which resulted in $1,006,000 of intangible asset impairment charges.    49    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)    In the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter. This constituted a change in the method of applying an accounting principle that the Company believes is preferable, as it better aligns the timing of the Companys goodwill impairment assessment with the Companys annual business planning and forecasting process. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company performed its goodwill impairment assessment which resulted in a charge of $12,000,000 related to the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service reporting unit in the Transportation segment.  In the first quarter of 2009, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment which resulted in impairment charges of $60,000,000 related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit and $18,000,000 related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit, which are both included in the Power Systems & Electronics segment.  Also in 2009, intangible asset impairments of $15,568,000 were recorded related to certain trademarks, brands and patents. Approximately $5,800,000 of this total charge related to the PC board fabrication reporting unit and the remainder to various trademarks, brands and patents of other reporting units.  The impairments during 2009 were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the preceding few years prior to the economic downturn in late 2008 and 2009. These charges were driven primarily by lower forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired.  A summary of goodwill and intangible assets that were adjusted to fair value and the related impairment charges included in earnings for 2009 is as follows:     The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:       50    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)    Intangible assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:     Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 20 years.  The estimated amortization expense of intangible assets for the future years ending December 31 is as follows:       Other Assets Other Assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of the following:       51    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)      Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  The Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, predominately in the U.S. covering a majority of U.S. employees.  The U.S. primary pension plan provides benefits based on years of service and final average salary. The U.S. primary postretirement healthcare plan is contributory with the participants contributions adjusted annually. The U.S. primary postretirement life insurance plan is noncontributory.  Beginning January 1, 2007, the U.S. primary pension and other postretirement benefit plans were closed to new participants. Newly hired employees and employees from acquired businesses that are not participating in these plans are eligible for additional Company contributions under the existing U.S. primary defined contribution retirement plans. The Companys expense related to defined contribution plans was $77,700,000 in 2011, $69,300,000 in 2010 and $66,000,000 in 2009.  In addition to the U.S. plans, the Company also has defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries, mainly the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany and Canada.  Summarized information regarding the Companys significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans related to both continuing and discontinued operations is as follows:       52    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)       As per XBRL need we need to split the into TWO                      Change in plan assets:                        Fair value of plan assets at January 1    $ 1,940,552      $ 1,750,904      $ 293,776      $ 259,753      Actual return on plan assets      108,495        187,688        3,357                34,023      Company contributions      130,535        73,720                32,673        33,224      Plan participants contributions      8,100        4,642        15,273        15,241      Acquisitions      15,344        26,115                          Benefits paid      (142,409 )      (137,753 )      (47,946 )      (48,465 )    Assets from other immaterial plans                44,860                          Foreign currency translation      (6,706 )      (9,624 )                                                                   Fair value of plan assets at December 31    $ 2,053,911      $ 1,940,552      $ 297,133      $ 293,776                                                 Funded status    $ (410,707 )    $ (360,188 )    $ (271,892 )    $ (265,647 )    Other immaterial plans      (63,655 )      (62,664 )      (7,458 )      (3,105 )                                               Net liability at December 31    $ (474,362 )    $ (422,852 )    $ (279,350 )    $ (268,752 )                                               The amounts recognized in the statement of financial position as of December 31 consist of:                        Assets held for sale    $ 75      $         $         $         Other assets      40,687        16,023                          Accrued expenses      (21,459 )      (15,378 )      (7,767 )      (9,025 )    Liabilities held for sale      (12,757 )                                  Other noncurrent liabilities      (480,908 )      (423,497 )      (271,583 )      (259,727 )                                               Net liability at end of year    $ (474,362 )    $ (422,852 )    $ (279,350 )    $ (268,752 )                                               The pre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income consist of:                        Net actuarial loss (gain)    $ 848,368      $ 758,901      $ 15,406      $ (1,840 )    Prior service cost      3,981        4,758        4,844        11,292      Net transition obligation      52        68                                                                        $ 852,401      $ 763,727      $ 20,250      $ 9,452                                                 Accumulated benefit obligation    $ 2,193,199      $ 2,084,663                                                 Plans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets as of December 31:                        Projected benefit obligation    $ 1,837,761      $ 1,722,577                                                 Accumulated benefit obligation    $ 1,665,360      $ 1,582,158                                                 Fair value of plan assets    $ 1,413,557      $ 1,379,466                                                  53    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)    Assumptions  The weighted-average assumptions used in the valuations of pension and other postretirement benefits were as follows:                                     Pension     Other Postretirement Benefits         2011     2010     2009     2011     2010     2009     Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:                                  Discount rate      4.64 %      5.05 %      5.57 %      4.95 %     5.45 %      5.80 %    Rate of compensation increases      3.86        3.94        4.18                                    Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31:                                  Discount rate      5.05 %      5.57 %      6.59 %      5.45 %      5.80 %      6.50 %    Expected return on plan assets      7.39        7.63        8.28        7.00        7.00        7.00      Rate of compensation increases      3.94        4.18        4.19                                   The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefit plans were developed using historical asset class returns while factoring in current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and asset class performance.  Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care benefit plans. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the postretirement benefit obligation at December 31 were as follows:                         2011     2010     2009     Health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year      8.50 %      8.71 %      8.21 %    Ultimate trend rate      5.00 %      5.00 %      5.00 %    Year the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate      2019        2020        2020     A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following impact:                 In Thousands    1-Percentage-Point Increase      1-Percentage-Point Decrease     Change in service cost and interest cost for 2011    $ 964       $ (1,406 )    Change in postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2011    $ 14,556       $ (17,480 )   Plan Assets  The Companys overall investment strategy for the assets in the pension funds is to achieve a balance between the goals of growing plan assets and keeping risk at a reasonable level over a long-term investment horizon. In order to reduce unnecessary risk, the pension funds are diversified across several asset classes, securities and investment managers. The target allocations for plan assets are 50% to 65% equity securities, 30% to 45% debt securities, 0% to 2% real estate and 0% to 10% in other types of investments. The Company does not use derivatives for the purpose of speculation, leverage, circumventing investment guidelines or taking risks that are inconsistent with specified guidelines.  The assets in the Companys postretirement health care plan are primarily invested in life insurance policies. The Companys overall investment strategy for the assets in the postretirement health care fund is to invest in assets that provide a reasonable tax exempt rate of return while preserving capital.  The following tables present the fair value of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, by asset category and valuation methodology. Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets. Level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market participants would be expected to use in pricing the assets. Each financial instruments categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.    54    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)                               2011     In Thousands    Level 1      Level 2      Level 3      Total     Pension Plan Assets:                           Cash and equivalents    $ 16,466       $          $          $ 16,466      Equity securities:                           Domestic      56,202                               56,202      Foreign      68,290                               68,290      Fixed income securities:                           Government securities                 217,840                    217,840      Corporate debt securities                 240,032         4,020         244,052      Mortgage-backed securities                 16,418                    16,418      Investment contracts with insurance companies                            69,285         69,285      Commingled funds:                           Mutual funds      344,891                               344,891      Collective trust funds                 931,735                    931,735      Partnerships/private equity interests                            86,869         86,869      Other                 916         947         1,863                                                       $ 485,849       $ 1,406,941       $ 161,121       $ 2,053,911                                                    Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets:                           Cash and equivalents    $ 33,675       $          $          $ 33,675      Life insurance policies                            263,458         263,458                                                       $ 33,675       $          $ 263,458       $ 297,133                                                                              2010     In Thousands    Level 1      Level 2      Level 3      Total     Pension Plan Assets:                           Cash and equivalents    $ 49,444       $          $          $ 49,444      Equity securities:                           Domestic      125,884                               125,884      Foreign      161,850                               161,850      Fixed income securities:                           Government securities                 193,940         1,025         194,965      Corporate debt securities                 219,546         2,667         222,213      Mortgage-backed securities                 9,621                    9,621      Investment contracts with insurance companies                 119,976                    119,976      Commingled funds:                           Mutual funds      300,716                               300,716      Collective trust funds                 678,082                    678,082      Partnerships/private equity interests                            77,587         77,587      Other                 204         10         214                                                       $ 637,894       $ 1,221,369       $ 81,289       $ 1,940,552                                                    Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets:                           Cash and equivalents    $ 28,065       $          $          $ 28,065      Life insurance policies                            265,711         265,711                                                       $ 28,065       $          $ 265,711       $ 293,776                                                     55    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)    Cash and equivalents include cash on hand and investments with maturities of 90 days or less and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Equity securities primarily include common and preferred equity securities covering a wide range of industries and geographies which are traded in active markets and are valued based on quoted prices. Fixed income securities primarily consist of U.S. and foreign government bills, notes and bonds, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and investment contracts. The majority of the assets in this category are valued by evaluating bid prices provided by independent financial data services. For securities where market data is not readily available, unobservable market data is used to value the security. Commingled funds include investments in public and private pooled funds. Mutual funds are traded in active markets and are valued based on quoted prices. The underlying investments include small-cap equity, international equity and long- and short-term fixed income instruments. Collective trust funds are private funds that are valued at the net asset value which is determined based on the fair value of the underlying investments. The underlying investments include both passively and actively managed U.S. and foreign large- and mid-cap equity funds and short-term investment funds. Partnerships/private equity interests are investments in partnerships where the benefit plan is a limited partner. The investments are valued by the investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use market, income and cost valuation methods. Life insurance policies are used to fund other postretirement benefits in order to obtain favorable tax treatment and are valued based on the cash surrender value of the underlying policies.  The following table presents a reconciliation of Level 3 assets measured at fair value for pension and other postretirement benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:                                         In Thousands    GovernmentSecurities     CorporateDebtSecurities     Mortgage-backedSecurities     InvestmentContracts withInsuranceCompanies      Partnerships/Private  EquityInterests     LifeInsurancePolicies     Other     Total     Balance Dec 31, 2009    $ 1,285      $ 2,092      $ 3,372      $          $ 68,847      $ 233,042      $ 2,226      $ 310,864      2010 Activity:                                             Realized gains (losses)      100        (452 )      (947 )                 3,547                  (17 )      2,231      Unrealized gains (losses)      (49 )      624        844                   (538 )      32,669        319        33,869      Purchases and sales      (311 )      (1,137 )      (3,269 )                 5,731                  (2,518 )      (1,504 )    Transfers                1,540                                                           1,540                                                                                          Balance Dec 31, 2010      1,025        2,667                             77,587        265,711        10        347,000      2011 Activity:                                             Realized gains                                               4,088                  4        4,092      Unrealized gains (losses)                118                  5,794         4,398        (2,253 )      (221 )      7,836      Purchases and sales                2,000                  2,192         796                  909        5,897      Transfers      (1,025 )      (765 )                61,299                             245        59,754                                                                                          Balance Dec 31, 2011    $         $ 4,020      $         $ 69,285       $ 86,869      $ 263,458      $ 947      $ 424,579                                                                                         Cash Flows  The Company generally funds its pension and other postretirement benefit plans as required by law or to the extent such contributions are tax deductible.

It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders. The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:     Foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2011 is net of a $55,297,000 increase for the resolution of an issue with the Internal Revenue Service in the U.S. related to a deduction for foreign exchange losses on an intercompany loan.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the ending balance of accumulated comprehensive income consisted of cumulative translation adjustment income of $773,367,000 and $913,888,000, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $549,144,000 and $486,733,000, respectively. The estimated unrecognized benefit cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 is $52,638,000 for pension and $3,337,000 for other postretirement benefits.    Stock Based Compensation Stock-Based Compensation  Stock options and restricted stock units have been issued to officers and other management employees under ITWs 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan). The stock options generally vest over a four-year period and have a maturity of ten years from the issuance date. Restricted stock units generally vest after a three-year period and include units with and without performance criteria. To cover the exercise of vested options and vesting of restricted stock units, the Company generally issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December 31, 2011, 51,244,986 shares of ITW common stock were reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Company records compensation expense for the grant date fair value of stock awards over the remaining service periods of those awards.  The following summarizes the Companys stock-based compensation expense:     Of the pre-tax compensation expense, $845,000, $783,000 and $729,000 were included in income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The following table summarizes activity related to non-vested restricted stock units during 2011:       61    Notes to Financial Statements(Continued)    The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Plan for the year ended December 31, 2011:     On February 10, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an annual equity award consisting of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance restricted stock units (PRSUs). The RSUs provide for full cliff vesting three years from the date of grant. The PRSUs provide for full cliff vesting after three years if the Compensation Committee certifies that the performance goals set with respect to the PRSU have been met. Upon vesting, the holder will receive one share of common stock of the Company for each vested RSU or PRSU. Option exercise prices are equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. Stock options were granted on 1,758,420 shares at an exercise price of $55.71 per share. Additionally, 550,308 RSUs and PRSUs were issued at the grant date share price of $55.71. The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs is determined by reducing the closing market price on the date of the grant by the present value of projected dividends over the vesting period. The Company uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted. The following summarizes the assumptions used in the models:     Lattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Companys stock and historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise timing and employee termination rates within the valuation model. The weighted-average dividend yield is based on historical information. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The ranges presented result from separate groups of employees assumed to exhibit different behavior.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $11.48, $12.34, $9.59 and $10.24 per share, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $63,480,000, $56,191,000 and $38,609,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2011 there was $27,762,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years. Exercise of options during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 resulted in cash receipts of $151,470,000, $113,627,000 and $101,613,000, respectively. The total fair value of vested stock option awards during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $32,955,000, $29,545,000 and $38,999,000, respectively.  As of December 31, 2011 there was $27,402,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 1.7 years.
