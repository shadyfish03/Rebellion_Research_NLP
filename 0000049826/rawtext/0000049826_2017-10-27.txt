In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting.New Accounting Pronouncements - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. Under current guidance, the Company generally recognizes operating revenue when ownership and risk of loss are transferred to the customer, which is typically at the time of product shipment or delivery of service. The Company has completed a review of revenue transactions for a significant portion of its businesses. While the review is not fully completed, the Company does not currently expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its operating revenue, results of operations or financial position. However, the Company expects to provide additional disclosures in the notes to financial statements required under the new guidance. The new guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and allows for either full or modified retrospective adoption methods. The Company expects to adopt the new revenue accounting guidance utilizing the modified retrospective method. In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and lease asset for all leases with a lease term greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position, including operating leases. Subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. In addition, several new disclosures will be required. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for its operating leases in the statement of financial position upon adoption. In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that included several changes to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification of tax benefits in the statement of cash flows. Among the more significant changes, the new guidance requires the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards to be recognized through income tax expense rather than directly in equity. Additionally, the income tax effects related to excess tax benefits should be presented within operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. Excess tax benefits recognized in equity under the prior guidance were $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2017 and applied the newly adopted provisions prospectively. Excess tax benefits of $6 million and $32 million were included in Income Taxes in the statement of income for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The expected effect on income tax expense or net cash provided from operating activities related to future stock-based award settlements will vary each quarter and will depend on inputs such as the stock price at the time of settlement and the number of awards settled in the period presented. In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than when transferred to a third party as required under the current guidance. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and will be applied prospectively with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded directly to retained earnings. Although the Company is currently completing its assessment of the potential impact of this new guidance, the Company anticipates a cumulative-effect balance sheet adjustment reducing deferred tax assets and retained earnings upon adoption. Additionally, intra-entity asset transfers may result in future tax rate volatility under the new guidance. The Company intends to complete its assessment in the fourth quarter of 2017.In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which changes the income statement presentation of the components of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The primary change under the new guidance is that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost should be included in operating income and is 7eligible for capitalization as an asset. The other components of net periodic benefit cost, such as interest cost, the expected return on assets, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost, should be presented below operating income. The guidance is effective for the Company starting January 1, 2018 and will be applied retrospectively to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost and prospectively to the capitalization of service cost. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position. Refer to Note 6. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for further information information regarding the Company’s net periodic benefit cost.(2)     AcquisitionOn July 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business ("EF&C") from ZF TRW for a purchase price of approximately $450 million. The acquisition of EF&C did not materially affect the Company’s results of operations or financial position for the periods presented. EF&C had operating revenue of $382 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 which was reported within the Company’s Automotive OEM segment. As a result of the EF&C transaction, the Company recorded $187 million of goodwill and $134 million of amortizable intangible assets primarily related to customer relationships and technology. The intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from 4 to 17 years, with a weighted average amortization period of 16 years. (3)    Income TaxesThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately $96 million related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency (“NOD”) from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of $70 million for the 2006 tax year, plus interest and penalties. In May 2014, the Company petitioned the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. The Company's petition was subsequently denied and the case proceeded to court with the trial taking place in the third quarter of 2016. Final decision by the tax court is expected in 2017 or 2018. Although the court's final decision cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes its position continues to be supportable. Accordingly, no reserve has been recorded related to this matter.(4)    InventoriesInventories as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows: (5)    Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarters of 2017 and 2016. The assessment resulted in no impairment charges in either 2017 or 2016.8(6)    Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsBeginning in 2017, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The new method provides a more precise measure of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively. The change did not have a material impact on the 2017 net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:The Company expects to contribute approximately $179 million to its pension plans and $6 million to its other postretirement plans in 2017. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company made contributions of $174 million to its pension plans, which included an additional $115 million discretionary contribution made in the second quarter of 2017. Contributions of $5 million have been made to other postretirement plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.(7)    DebtShort-term debt as of September 30, 2017 included commercial paper of $688 million. Short-term debt as of December 31, 2016 included $650 million related to the 0.90% notes paid on the February 25, 2017 due date.The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt presented as short-term debt, as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows: The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a valuation model using Level 2 observable inputs which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods.(8)    Legal SettlementIn the second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a $95 million confidential settlement agreement to resolve a litigation matter. Based on the terms of the agreement, the Company received the settlement within 120 days of the execution of the agreement. The receipt of the settlement resulted in a favorable pre-tax impact of $15 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $80 million in the third quarter of 2017, which was included in operating income.9(9)    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)The following table summarizes changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30,In millions20172016 2017 2016Beginning balance$(1,516) $(1,470) $(1,807) $(1,504)        Foreign currency translation adjustments during the period67 (15) 271 (15)Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income— — — 1Income taxes29 10 96 29Total foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax96 (5) 367 15        Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments during the period— — — 1Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income15 11 42 31Income taxes(2) (4) (9) (11)Total pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments, net of tax13 7 33 21        Ending balance$(1,407) $(1,468) $(1,407) $(1,468)        Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income relate primarily to the amortization of actuarial losses. Refer to Note 6. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for additional information.The Company designated the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2015 and the €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2014 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. The carrying values of the 2015 and 2014 Euro notes were $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2017. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The unrealized pre-tax gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was $118 million and $375 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.The ending balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2017 and 2016 consisted of cumulative translation adjustment losses, net of tax, of $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $372 million and $358 million, respectively.(10)    Segment InformationThe Company has seven reportable segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenue and operating income for the Company's segments.10ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsINTRODUCTIONIllinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 85 divisions in 57 countries. As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed approximately 50,000 persons.The Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company's decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.THE ITW BUSINESS MODELThe powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company’s core source of value creation. This business model is the Company’s competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements:•ITW’s 80/20 management process is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data-driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the “80”) and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the “20”). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;•Customer-back innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company’s unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 management process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their “80” customers. ITW’s innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in “80” markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and subsequently creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of more than 17,000 granted and pending patents;•ITW’s decentralized, entrepreneurial culture allows ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services adapted to each business' customers and end markets.ENTERPRISE STRATEGYIn late 2012, ITW began the process of transitioning the Company onto its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model. Since then, ITW has made considerable progress, as evidenced by the Company’s strong financial performance over the past four years.The roots of ITW’s Enterprise Strategy began in late 2011 / early 2012, when the Company undertook a complete review of its performance. Focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, ITW developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.11Based on this rigorous evaluation, ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. To shift its primary growth engine to organic, the Company began executing a multi-step approach.•The first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of ITW’s business portfolio. As part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.As a result of this work, ITW’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. ITW segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. The Company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses’ largest / most profitable customers and product lines. With the initiative nearly complete and ITW businesses demonstrating notably improved financial performance, the Company believes that the significant product line simplification work is essentially finalized and will return to more normalized levels in 2017 and beyond.•Step two, Business Structure Simplification, was implemented to simplify and scale-up ITW’s operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and, at the same time, improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 85 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.•The Strategic Sourcing initiative was established as a core capability to better leverage ITW’s scale and improve global competitiveness. Sourcing is now a core strategic and operational capability at ITW. The Company’s 80/20-enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2016 and is on track to do the same in 2017 and 2018.•With the portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the Company was able to shift its focus to preparing for and accelerating, organic growth. As a preparatory step, ITW is in the process of reapplying 80/20 to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.Once the business has achieved operational excellence and identified the right growth opportunities, the final step is to accelerate organic growth. The process of preparing for accelerated organic growth generally takes 18 to 24 months.Based on the financial performance of the divisions that are further along in this process, the Company believes that its organic growth framework is capable of delivering above-market organic growth across all segments. Divisions are at various phases in preparation for growth and many are either ready to grow or already growing above their respective markets. ITW management is fully aligned with this plan and very focused on executing it. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 85 percent of the divisions were ready to grow.PATH TO FULL POTENTIALWhile the Company has made considerable progress and ITW’s performance is nearing best-in-class levels, the Company has significant opportunity for further improvement before it achieves full operating potential. In order to do so, ITW is focused on two key areas of opportunity, including: additional structural margin improvement and sustained above-market organic growth with strong incremental profitability.Additional Structural Margin ImprovementTo deliver on the additional structural margin improvement, the Company is implementing the following two levers: (1) further leveraging the 80/20 management process and (2) strategic sourcing.•The first lever, better leveraging the full power of the ITW Business Model, will be accomplished through a much more consistent and focused approach to 80/20 best practice implementation across the Company. The 80/20 management system has continuously been refined, improved and expanded into a unique holistic business management process of interconnected tools, which improves all aspects of the business and, when applied 12consistently and executed more effectively, will lead to additional margin improvement. ITW has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company’s operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. These 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.•The second lever, strategic sourcing, is a core element of ITW’s ongoing operational strategy and a sustainable enterprise-wide capability. Through the continued execution of this initiative, the Company expects to deliver additional margin improvement with the goal of a one percent reduction in spend in 2017 and 2018.Sustained Above-Market Organic Growth with Strong Incremental ProfitabilityITW has done extensive work on its portfolio and operating structure to position the Company to deliver sustainable above-market organic growth. The Company has narrowed the focus and significantly improved the growth potential of ITW’s business portfolio. With approximately 85% of its divisions ready to grow as of the end of 2016, ITW is well positioned for accelerated growth in 2017 and beyond. To deliver on this accelerated growth, the divisions have been implementing the organic growth framework, which includes continued investment in customer-back innovation and a strengthened focus on market penetration. ITW continues to focus on growing its share of "80" products with existing customers with whom the Company has a resonant value proposition as well as target potential new customers with similar pain points to existing customers. ITW has made strong progress on the Company’s pivot to organic growth and is well positioned to deliver on sustained above-market organic growth over the long-term.TERMS USED BY ITWManagement uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the Company:•Organic business - acquired businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis.•Operating leverage - the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period.•Price/cost - represents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers.•Product line simplification (PLS) - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines; in the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. In the long-term, PLS is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.Unless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year. The following discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe Company's strong third quarter and year-to-date financial performance reflected continued progress leveraging the powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model and executing enterprise initiatives. Six of seven segments achieved worldwide organic revenue growth in the third quarter, and all seven segments had organic revenue growth in the year-to-date period. All seven segments had operating margin at or above 21% in both respective periods.On July 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business ("EF&C") from ZF TRW for a purchase price of approximately $450 million. In 2017, EF&C had operating revenue of $126 million in the third quarter and $382 million in the year-to-date period. EF&C diluted the Company's operating margin by 40 basis points in the year-to-date period due to lower operating margin and acquisition related expenses. The Company expects EF&C's operating margin to improve in later years through the application of the Company's 80/20 business management process. The operating results of EF&C are reported within the Company's Automotive OEM segment. The acquisition of EF&C did not materially affect the Company's results of operations or financial position for any period presented. Refer to Note 2. Acquisition in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition.13The Company’s consolidated results of operations for the third quarter and year-to-date periods were as follows:•Operating revenue grew in the third quarter primarily due to an increase in organic revenue and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. In the year-to-date period, operating revenue grew primarily due to an increase in organic and acquisition revenues.•Organic revenue grew 1.9% and 2.7% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Six segments achieved worldwide organic revenue growth in the third quarter, and all seven segments achieved growth in the year-to-date period. In the third quarter, Food Equipment declined 0.4% primarily due to lower equipment demand in North America. ◦North American organic revenue was flat in the third quarter. Growth in the Welding, Specialty Products, Construction Products and Polymers & Fluids segments was offset by a decline in the Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Test & Measurements and Electronics segments. In the year-to-date period, organic revenue grew 1.0%. Growth in five segments was partially offset by a decline in the Food Equipment and Automotive OEM segments.◦Europe, Middle East and Africa organic revenue increased 2.4% in the third quarter as growth in the Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, Construction Products and Specialty Products segments was partially offset by a decline in the Welding, Polymers & Fluids and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments. Organic revenue increased 3.8% in the year-to-date period as growth in six segments was partially offset by a decline in the Welding segment. ◦Asia Pacific organic revenue increased 8.1% in the third quarter as all seven segments achieved organic revenue growth.

Significant Accounting Policies in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further information.22NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. Under current guidance, the Company generally recognizes operating revenue when ownership and risk of loss are transferred to the customer, which is typically at the time of product shipment or delivery of service. The Company has completed a review of revenue transactions for a significant portion of its businesses. While the review is not fully completed, the Company does not currently expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its operating revenue, results of operations or financial position. However, the Company expects to provide additional disclosures in the notes to financial statements required under the new guidance. The new guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and allows for either full or modified retrospective adoption methods. The Company expects to adopt the new revenue accounting guidance utilizing the modified retrospective method.In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and lease asset for all leases with a lease term greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position, including operating leases. Subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. In addition, several new disclosures will be required. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for its operating leases in the statement of financial position upon adoption. In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that included several changes to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification of tax benefits in the statement of cash flows. Among the more significant changes, the new guidance requires the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards to be recognized through income tax expense rather than directly in equity. Additionally, the income tax effects related to excess tax benefits should be presented within operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. Excess tax benefits recognized in equity under the prior guidance were $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2017 and applied the newly adopted provisions prospectively. Excess tax benefits of $6 million and $32 million were included in Income Taxes in the statement of income for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The expected effect on income tax expense or net cash provided from operating activities related to future stock-based award settlements will vary each quarter and will depend on inputs such as the stock price at the time of settlement and the number of awards settled in the period presented.In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than when transferred to a third party as required under the current guidance. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and will be applied prospectively with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded directly to retained earnings. Although the Company is currently completing its assessment of the potential impact of this new guidance, the Company anticipates a cumulative-effect balance sheet adjustment reducing deferred tax assets and retained earnings upon adoption. Additionally, intra-entity asset transfers may result in future tax rate volatility under the new guidance. The Company intends to complete its assessment in the fourth quarter of 2017.In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which changes the income statement presentation of the components of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The primary change under the new guidance is that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost should be included in operating income and is eligible for capitalization as an asset. The other components of net periodic benefit cost, such as interest cost, the expected return on assets, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost, should be presented below operating income. The guidance is effective for the Company starting January 1, 2018 and will be applied retrospectively to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost and prospectively to the capitalization of service cost. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position. Refer to Note 6. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further information information regarding the Company’s net periodic benefit cost.23LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had $2.8 billion of cash on hand at September 30, 2017 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:•internal investments to support organic growth and sustain core businesses;•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; and•external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support the Company's organic growth focus, and an active share repurchase program.The Company believes that, based on its revenue, operating margin, current free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.Cash FlowThe Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. Summarized cash flow information for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2017 and 2016 was as follows:Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 included an additional $115 million discretionary pension contribution made in the second quarter of 2017.Stock Repurchase ProgramOn February 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the “2015 Program”). Under the 2015 Program, the Company repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $94.07 in the first quarter of 2016, approximately 4.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $104.54 in the second quarter of 2016, approximately 4.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $116.27 in the third quarter of 2016, approximately 4.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $117.29 in the fourth quarter of 242016, approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $128.47 in the first quarter of 2017, approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $136.81 in the second quarter of 2017, and approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $142.54 in the third quarter of 2017. As of September 30, 2017, there were approximately $2.7 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2015 Program.Adjusted After-Tax Return on Average Invested CapitalThe Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. ROIC for the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2017 and 2016 was as follows:ROIC increased 330 basis points for the three month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period as a result of a 20.1% improvement in after-tax operating income versus a 5.0% increase in adjusted average invested capital.

Net working capital as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is summarized as follows:Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $2.8 billion as of September 30, 2017 and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2016, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries. Cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash and equivalents balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs, which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.DebtTotal debt as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was as follows:Short-term debt as of September 30, 2017 included commercial paper of $688 million. Short-term debt as of December 31, 2016 included $650 million related to the 0.90% notes paid on the February 25, 2017 due date.26Total Debt to EBITDAThe Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA as a measure of its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by net income before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. Total debt to EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was as follows:Stockholders’ EquityThe changes to stockholders’ equity during 2017 were as follows:In millions Total stockholders’ equity, December 31, 2016$4,259Net income1,763Repurchases of common stock(750)Cash dividends declared(715)Foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax367Stock option and restricted stock activity73Other29Total stockholders’ equity, September 30, 2017$5,026FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
